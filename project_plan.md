# Project Plan

## Individual Contributions to Academic Interactions

The amount of speech contributed by an individual in an interaction has been observed to be conditioned by social factors, such as relations of power and solidarity. Interactions in academic settings allow for the effects of social factors to be examined in somewhat controlled contexts that vary by interaction type, number of participants, and the characteristics of the participants. This research project will look at data from the [Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/c/corpus/corpus) (MICASE) to analyze the effect that these variations in social factors have one the amount of speech that individuals contribute to academic interactions.

## Data

MICASE contains 152 transcripts of academic speech events recorded at the University of Michigan in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Of these 152 transcripts, this project will focus on a subset of 75 transcripts that are listed as "Highly interactive" or "Mostly interactive". The transcripts are available in XML files which include information on the speech event and the participants involved, in addition to the entire transcript. As such, the [`xml2` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xml2/index.html) will be necessary for parsing the transcript data in R. The [`purrr` package](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) can also be used here to simplify the code needed to read in all the different files. The [`tibble` package](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) will be useful for extracting elements of the XML files into a rectangular data frame which will be more practical for data manipulation and analysis. The "rectangling" functions of [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) may also prove to be useful for converting data from the XML files into a tidy tibble format.

## Analysis

As the data frame(s) for this project will be constructed in R from hierarchical data files, the [`dplyr` package](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) will be indispensable for manipulating the data for analysis. The end goal of this project is an analysis on the effects that an individual's social position has on their level of participation in a speech interaction. This will require calculating the contribution of each individual in each interaction, and I am hopeful that the string manipulation functions of [`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) can be used to achieve this. Once the data has been processed accordingly, the [`ggplot2` package](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) will be used to visualize the patterns seen in the analysis. One pattern that I hypothesize will arise is that certain contexts will show higher levels of participation for individuals who are institutionally "permitted" to hold the floor for longer, such as teachers speaking more than any other individual in classroom settings or students speaking more than teachers in student presentation settings. In other contexts, like office hours for a class where institutional "permission" may be more relaxed, I would expect there to be a more equal distribution of speech contribution. I further hypothesize that these contexts which are less institutionally formalized would show greater gender differences between individuals who hold similar positions, with men speaking more than women because the imbalance in social power would enable them to do so.
