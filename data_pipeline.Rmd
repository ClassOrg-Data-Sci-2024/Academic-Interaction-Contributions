# Data overview

The data used in this project comes from the [Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/c/corpus/corpus) (MICASE) which contains transcripts of academic speech events recorded at the University of Michigan in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The transcripts are available as XML files which contain metadata on the speech event and the participants involved, as well as the entire transcript.
This metadata includes information on the type of speech event, the primary discourse mode, the level of interactivity,the number of participants and speakers, the English language proficiency of speakers, the academic roles of participants, and the gender and age group for each speaker.
Specifically, this project works with the 75 interactions that are categorized within MICASE as "Highly interactive" or "Mostly interactive". 
These 75 transcripts represent roughly 6,360 minutes of recorded speech interactions.

# Data pipeline

The code presented here reads in the 75 XML files for this project and then extracts data from the nested structure of the XML files, so that it can be input into a tibble that will be used for analysis.

```{r data pipeline}

file_list <- list.files("Data", pattern="*.xml", full.names=TRUE)

#Brief samples of the current data frame
head(micase_df)
tail(micase_df)
```

The file name is included in the data frame so that each utterance can be connected to the transcription that it came from.
The type of speech event is included so that the data can be analyzed for potential differences in speech contributions across speech event types.
All speaker information provided by the transcript is retained in the data frame.
Indications of overlapping speech are not included in the data frame in order to keep the data tidy.
Indications of overlaps may be added at a later time if deemed relevant enough to the analysis to be included.
The decision to separate the utterances into two levels of utterances is based on the structure of the MICASE transcriptions where U1 nodes represent a speaker taking a full conversation turn and U2 nodes represent a speaker responding verbally without taking a full conversation turn.

## Initial data cleaning

Separating the two utterance levels caused "/n" strings to be created in first-level utterances at positions where second-level utterances were originally nested.
These strings should be removed as they are not part of the data being analyzed.
Additionally, the [MICASE Manual](https://ca.talkbank.org/access/0docs/MICASE.pdf) explains in Table 3-2 that words that were "completely unintelligible" were transcribed as two x's in parentheses.
These will also be removed from the data, as it is difficult to quantify the conversational contribution of a word or words that are not known.
It was also discovered that participants who have values "ALL" or "CITE" values in `RESTRICT` have had their speech redacted from the corpus.
Due to this, these restricted utterances will also be removed from the dataset.
The MICASE manual also states that utterances with an "SS" value in the `WHO` column are from two or more speakers in unison, which makes it difficult to link these contributions to specific speakers.
As such, these utterances will be removed.

```{r}
#saving changes to a new df so that the original is still around if I need it
micase_df_turns <- micase_df %>% 
  #mutating across the text column to replace whitespace at the beginning and end of lines with nothing,
  #all other whitespace with a single space, all "\n" with nothing, and all "(xx)" with nothing
  mutate(across(text, ~ (str_replace_all(.x, c("^\\s" = "", "\\s$" = "", "\\s+" = " ", "\\n" = "", "\\(xx\\)" = ""))))) %>% 
  #removing all text cells that contain "RESTRICTED" values
  filter(text != "RESTRICTED") %>% 
  #dropping the RESTRICT column because it is not informative with the "RESTRICTED" values removed
  select(!RESTRICT) %>% 
  #removing all rows with WHO cells that contain "SS" values
  filter(speaker_id != "SS")
```

# Creating a word token data frame

The current data frame is structured in a way that is useful to analyze turn-taking among conversational participants.
In addition to this, a longer data frame will be created where each word token has its own cell in the data frame in order to analyze the number of words spoken by each conversation participant.

```{r}
micase_df_words <- micase_df_turns %>% 
  #split the strings in the text column by whitespace
  mutate(across(text, ~ (strsplit(.x, "\\s")))) %>% 
  #unnest the column so that every word is its own cell
  unnest(cols=c("text")) %>% 
  #remove any rows with empty "text" cells
  filter(text != "")
```

## Counting instances of non-lexicals, backchannels, and exclamations

The MICASE Manual lists all the transcription conventions used for hesitation and filler words, backchannel cues, exclamations, and truncated words which allows all these instances to be counted in a straightforward way.
Getting counts of these phenomena will be helpful in guiding how the analysis handles them.

```{r}
#concatenating the regexs to be mapped over to find hesitations, backchannels, exclamations, and truncations
nonlexical_regexs <- c(hesitation = "^(hm|hm'|huh|mm|mhm|uh|um|mkay)[^\\w\\s]?$", 
                       backchannel = "^(okey-doke|okey-dokey|uhuh|yeah|yep|yuhuh|uh'uh|huh'uh|'m'm|huh'uh)[^\\w\\s]?$", 
                       exclamation = "^(ach|ah|ahah|gee|jeez|oh|ooh|oop|oops|tch|ugh|uh'oh|whoa|yay)[^\\w\\s]?$", 
                       truncated = "-[^\\w\\s]?$")

#saving a count of the total cells in micase_df_words
total_word_count <- sum(micase_df_words %>% count())

#creating a word counter function that takes a regex string as input
word_counter <- function(regex_string) {
  micase_df_words %>% 
    #filtering micase_df_words based on cells in the text column that match the regex string
    filter(str_detect(text, regex_string)) %>% 
    #getting a count of the words matched
    count() %>% 
    #creating a column for the percentage of the total word count that are matched strings
    mutate(percentage_of_total = sum(n)/total_word_count)
}

#mapping the concatenated regex strings over the word_counter() function
map_dfr(nonlexical_regexs, word_counter, .id = "category")
```

Based on these total counts, exclamations will be removed from the data frame because they represent less than one percent of the total data. 
These word counts are being used as a quantifiable proxy for a speaker's level of engagement with a speech event, so truncated words, hesitations, and filler words will also be removed but backchannel cues will be retained.

```{r}
micase_df_words <- micase_df_words %>% 
  #using filter() to select every row that does not match the three regex strings
  filter(!str_detect(text, hesitation_regex),
         !str_detect(text, exclamation_regex),
         !str_detect(text, truncated_regex))
```


# Turn-taking analysis

Examining contributions in academic interactions by the number of turns taken will be accomplished with the `micase_df_turns` dataframe that has been created.
The MICASE Manual describes utterances tagged as second-level as "Backchannel cues from a speaker who doesn’t hold the floor and unsuccessful attempts to take the floor" (p. 14), so the initial analysis will only focus on first-level utterances which represent speakers successfully taking the floor.

```{r}
micase_df_turns %>% 
  #filtering to just look at first-level utterances
  filter(level == "u1") %>% 
  #adding count column for total turns taken in event
  add_count(file, name = "event_turn_total") %>% 
  #using group_by to organize turns according to the file they come from and the ID value from WHO column
  group_by(file, speaker_id) %>% 
  #adding count column for all turns taken by each speaker in every file
  add_count(name = "speaker_turns") %>% 
  #adding column calculating the the percentage of turns contributed by each speaker in every event
  mutate(percent_turns_contributed = speaker_turns/event_turn_total) %>% 
  #dropping columns that aren't relevant to analysis
  select(-c(unique_id, level, text)) %>% 
  #using slice to select the first row of each group
  ##essentially providing a single row for each speaker in every interaction
  ##while still retaining the metadata information for the speaker
  slice(1) %>% 
  #filtering out speakers who contributed less than 1% of words to event
  filter(percent_turns_contributed >= 0.01) %>% 
  #creating geom_count() plot with SEX on the x-axis and percent_turns_contributed on the y-axis
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = percent_turns_contributed)) + 
  geom_count()
```


# Word count analysis

micase_df_words %>% 
  add_count(file, name = "event_word_total") %>% 
  #using group_by to organize turns according to the file they come from and the ID value from WHO column

  #adding count column for all turns taken by each speaker in every file
  add_count(name = "speaker_words") %>% 
  #adding column calculating the the percentage of turns contributed by each speaker in every event
