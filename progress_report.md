# Progress Report

## Entry #1: 02/20/2024

I have created the GitHub repository for my final project on [individual contributions in academic interactions](https://github.com/ClassOrg-Data-Sci-2024/Academic-Interaction-Contributions) and have created or modified the following files:

-   `README.md` now includes the title of the project, my name, and a short summary of the project.

-   `.gitignore` now includes the macOS .gitignore template and to ignore files in the local `private/` directory.

-   `LICENSE.md` has been created, but it only includes placeholder text.

-   `project_plan.md` has been created and contains information on the project's scope, as well as plans for data manipulation and analysis.

-   `progress_report.md` has been created with the information that you are now reading (to paraphrase Virginia Woolf â€” yes, dear reader, this document is alive, but don't worry about it).
