          it's, it's our assumptions about how things work, it's the, beliefs and values, that, enable us to give, the same object or the same experience, similar meaning,          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>

          so you and i come to a a red light, cuz we live in the same culture and have that same shared experience around what a red light means we both know that it means, stop, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but it's like it's a never-changing thing like, always growing, like with the stop example,          <OVERLAP1> that's kind </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          of more um, concrete like stop always means stops          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and i i would say that it for the next hundred years it'll probably always mean stops stop, but with American political culture like it's always changing and like during campaigning the way you do it it's always different so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. well there's nothing that says that, we have an American political culture that has the same values beliefs, and assumptions forever and ever and ever right? no. i mean it's still made up of the same, things assumptions beliefs values. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's like based on the          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's like uh, through our daily norms and through our life we're told we have to do something this way and therefore we become accustomed to it,          <OVERLAP1> and so, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so we </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          it's just you practice what you see everyone else is doing like in Ann Arbor, stop doesn't mean stop.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it doesn't </U2>
          so maybe it does when you're you know so like you were saying it- it is always changing i mean          <OVERLAP1> stop, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          so i'm sure a lot of people came to Ann Arbor and they're like oh i'm gonna stop and then they see no one else stops,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
