       <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that was, seventy-nine i think. what year were you born? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> seventy-nine. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's what i thought.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually a lot of the research was done in seventy-nine, i've been noticing. like Reddy, wrote his article in seventy-nine. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah that was the big metaphor, seventy-nine eighty. uh, when i wrote that, i had read a, a draft, one of many prepublication drafts of Lakoff and Johnson. and so i knew pretty much what was in it. but uh, book didn't come out until later. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. thank you. and, i found, an amazing amount of,          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          information so, i haven't gotten to get, through all of it yet, but um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> has she gotten, recording levels? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think so. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. alright.          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          alright. okay so, these were from the web or from the literature?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i found, one useful one from the web, most of 'em from the web were, um, there was something that was set up, as, a a conversational thing for, a linguistics class, and so it was just questions and replies          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh i see. </U2>
          and there were four hundred and twenty-one entries and the first_          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          out of the first fifty i think forty of them were          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          were just, questions and replies that weren't too, helpful.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          but, i did find, i actually found something in Japanese that, if i could find some way to get it translated because the whole thing was on the conduit metaphor, and there were just random, um, translations, into English, every, third page or so, but.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh my word. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> wow. well, ask Jessica i guess. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. she said that she's not,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that good? </U2>
          that good with characters. she's better with          <OVERLAP1> speaking. so. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          could be. still there's lots of Japanese linguists.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the most exciting thing i found though... is this. it's Wong Scollon and          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> Scollon </U2>
          here's the, the first page of the abstract.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is from, Multilingua sixteen one, nineteen seven, ninety-seven.          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          ah root metaphors. okay yes i remember that. that used to be... that used to be the big phrase about the middle of the century. root metaphors for civilization.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> has a better re- theory theory place- replaced it now or? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well... they weren't exactly looking at metaphor. they were, more looking for things that motivate cultures. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, like the root metaphors of fascism. that sort of thing. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. she looked specifically at Cantonese and English metaphors, and then </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. well she's got a m- a- a more modern sense of what metaphor means.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          yeah.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          based on the human body. why am i not surprised?          <EVENT DUR=":13" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          ooh that's an interesting take on the American metaphor.          <SEG TYPE="READING"> an abstract ideal trying to free itself from biological and social restrictions through communication. </SEG>
          yeah. inside and outside.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so she said that a container metaphor, and a colonization metaphor, were the two primary metaphors in English. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> what was the first one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> a- w- just the conduit metaphor the container metaphor. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> a- a- and          <OVERLAP1> colonization. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and then </OVERLAP1>
          colonization. right. and she says that it comes from, American, popular American myth. of        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> westward ho? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> ooh. that really does cling you know that uh, that resonates in a lot of different ways. i like that. ooh colonization. you get imperialism. you get hegemony. you get, you get the gender wars. you get... you get east west, north south. </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> she also talks about the importance of creative development within the individual. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> creative development? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. but within the individual rather than, creative development of the entire network, of the entire social network which is what, the Cantonese metaphor is, which is the opposite, but she says that, uh, the American metaphor really focuses on, the very self-centered, creative development of the individual. and i think that works with the colonization idea too, because it's a very... it's the very small group of... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. it also suggests that the American view of the self, is, sort of takes the, mind body, difference wholeheartedly, and identifies with the mind it isn't integrated with the body. whereas the Chinese metaphor is integrated          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and the Chinese individuals are, personally integrated and they integrate with their society... which probably has a whole lot more survival value than the American metaphor as evidenced by the success of Chinese culture. mm. ooh that sounds like fun. colonized self. free (xx) colonized self. oh the, the self has been colonized by the body? by        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the self has been colonized by, these individual containers, for, not necessarily for meaning but for aspects of the self, so, actually the American data that she has is from Carbaugh's, study on Donahue,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and so          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it's, from talk shows and, it's a lot of talk about, um feminist theory, and, how, within, the female individual, there's a, an aspect of feminism. and so... i think that's what she means by colonization of        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i think          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> the </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> wha- </OVERLAP1>
          she- she's maybe dealing with a... a gloss. obviously it's a structure. obviously it's complicated. and maybe colonization is the best she can get to. but i don't think we should necessarily take the name as meaning too much.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          but yes that sounds like uh definitely worth reading. mm yum.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> she actually has an appendix at the back too of Chinese, proverbs uh m- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <SEG TYPE="READING"> oh. explode big cauldron reveal somebody else's inside story ooh. </SEG>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually in the last part of that, of her metaphorical analysis of Chinese_ what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> seven mouths eight tongue all talking at once. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> she says that school teachers say that to classrooms of children to make them be quiet. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> wow wonderful. Chinese are so earthy.           <SEG TYPE="READING"> teeth brush brush. </SEG>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <SEG TYPE="READING"> to be voluble to boast of oneself </SEG>

         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so she was saying that in contrast to, the American conduit metaphor that, the Chinese metaphor, um, holds a strict, importance on keeping what's inside inside, and keeping what's outside outside so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> and face in the middle. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm. okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. yeah exactly. hm. you seriously interested in China? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. i took the, Chuang Tzu course last,          <OVERLAP1> semester. yeah. Chuang Tzu </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh you did? Chuang Tzu? oh, </OVERLAP1>
          my favorite philosopher.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh? </U2>
          he's the only religious writer that has good jokes.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah,            <OVERLAP2> he does. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> ever, anywhere. </OVERLAP1>
          uh in that case let me recommend a book, called Bridge of Birds. it's a fantasy novel. i use it in my, uh metaphors class. freshman seminar at the R-C. it's terrific.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, and it is a novel and it's a very fantastic novel, it's a very Chinese novel, uh but all the facts, except for the, you know the fantastic parts,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but it's hard to tell which are fantastic and which are just Chinese. cuz Chinese history is a little fantastic in places, uh are true i mean all the uh, almost everybody in the book that's, actually, sounds like they oughta be a historical personage was a historical personage and did something like what they did in the book so it is, you're never quite sure where you are in this book. very interesting.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. that was my first introduction to Eastern thought,          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well that's </OVERLAP1>
          the right one, i think. ah, Confucious is a waste of time, t- as an introduction i think. all it all it does is give you the idea you don't wanna go there. but Chuang Tzu. hm.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. uh, so, how does this fit in with your experiment? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. i'm starting to realize that, metaphors of self, in, within the American framework and the Chinese, framework, have a lot to do with the metaphors for communication. and, that might be something that's, sort of inherent, just in the nature of communication but i thought it was an interesting, thing that, both, Wong Scollon and, um Carbaugh, who were studying communication, put such an emphasis on, the different cultural ideas of self. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, they're calling it self. uh the question is exactly which, variety of concept, they're talking about. there are a number,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and they can be distinguished there's probably whole branches of philosophy, that do nothing more than distinguish, soul from mind from self from personality from,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> uh, </OVERLAP1>
          you know, a whole lot of other stuff.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          id, ego, uh... and, i tend to think of it, as, well... one of a number of possible ways of, the m- i tend to think of it as the mind but you know that includes all that stuff, and there's a lot of different ways to talk about it. there is definitely an inside going on, in almost everything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it's interesting though that, as for my research the only part that really matters, is the socialized real- the socially realized conception, of self. so, what comes through in, social institutions. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> comes through? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. like          <OVERLAP1> within </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          uh through religion, through the dominant, literature, philosophy, arts, um          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you look </OVERLAP1>
          at, Chinese literature, and especially, i- i really, i don't know too much about this subject but, even, look at Chuang Tzu and the fact that the book was, compiled        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> inner chapters and outer chapters </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well up to a point. ah there you get into, the, de re de dicto distinction.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, what was it, there's a, there's a famous joke, about the classic professor, who spent his career proving, that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not composed by Homer, but by another blind Greek poet of the same name... whereas, Virgil, if you tried to do the same thing about the Eniad, it wouldn't be a joke. it'd be dull, but it wouldn't be a joke. cuz Virgil was a historic personage. we know other things about Virgil. but we know nothing else about, Homer except number one he was blind number two he was Greek and number three he composed the Iliad and the Odyssey. or at least did something, that stuck his name on those particular tellings of them.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... but what i think is interesting, is not necessarily, the de dicto de re distinction and, what actually matters, but what the different societies think matters. because          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U2>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes, exactly. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, that's what i think is interesting in a concept of self. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. yeah. i think that's right. uh, and we don't exactly ha- it's not like some things, it's not like metaphors for a number of, phenomena where we have physical reality to fall back on as something to reflect them off. but, nobody has any idea what self means if anything. except everybody has the idea that they're inside and everybody else is inside them, their their own, skulls or bodies or, persona or whatever.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and that in a sense you can't get out and you can't figure out what's going on other places. so there's a basic, basic container metaphor. but beyond that it can be elaborated in all kinds of different ways. it could be porous. it could be, it could be opaque. could be um, with many doors and windows. and you get into things like houses, Freud's house metaphors. you dream of a house you're dreaming of your mind. and you're trapped inside, secret passages, attics basements.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> see and that's interesting because the, something that Scollon said was that, um one of the really dominant, communication metaphors for Chinese is, of, bodily secretions so, the idea of the container is very porous </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that sounds so Chinese yep. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then one of the dominant metaphors for, English m- for American English metaphor, um is, more of a concrete container more of a house, doors and windows, box          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

          yes. yes. um... i wonder if the Chinese if the homunculus ever, the theory ever ever, had any currency in Chinese philosophy. i don't know. you know the, the homunculus is up here there's this, person behind your eyes who's sort of driving. the question is you know what's in their head? well it's another one even smaller etcetera.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          as long as it's, as long as it uh, it- it's tail recursive then it's okay you know each one gets simpler and simpler. but you do run the risk of infinite regress. um, but the, it sounds like the Chinese, don't bother with that. they're there, and they're one person. and there's no nonsense.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and it seems like the important part is that they're within the social network. not that their one person,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          i see. okay. um, well there's this, kind of programming, called object-oriented programming. and, it's, uh ordinarily... programming started off with, you know everything was do this do this do this do this do this do this. it's all orders. and, then it turned out that, the smart way to do it, was to define large complicated structures, very much in the way S-G-M-L does. and once you once you define that stuff then, you can write a program for that particular thing like suppose you want to, you want to add complex numbers. well you can't just use a regular plus. so you have to have a special meaning of plus for complex numbers. so, but you don't wanna have to try and worry about, is this a complex number do i use this plus or that plus or something else. so what you do is you say, uh w- i won't worry about is this a number, i'll just send it a plus and let it decide which plus to use, cuz it knows. that's called operator overloading. plus is a, is an operator. and it's overloaded because it has one meaning in this context one meaning in that context one meaning in some other context and so on. and, that's this kind of thing.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

          that's right. well i- i-, clearly the self is a product of conversation, of communication. as you say it comes through. that's all we can know about other people is what we observe and what we communicate with them and the inferences we draw. and and how well their, uh, our internal predictions are met or, exceeded or abashed by v- various things.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          uh, so i- there's a sense in which communication and the self sort of mutually create each other so that would make them a good, a good, candidate for this sort of thing. uh, did they go through, i've forgotten what_ there's a special name for a special a one one of their best examples, um, Turner and Fauconnier is, uh, like, lemme see X is the Y of Z. did they they run through those things?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> not in this </U2>

          and you can set it up to, uh to show how how they work, and what it what it means to say that sort of thing. and you can even, they can even get reflexive like, one i actually heard. uh Cadillac is the Rolls Royce of American automobiles. or of automobiles in general. it's, wait a minute you know you m- and yet it works.        </U1>

          that uses research i'm not really sure how i'd, incorporate the two. but... i'd be interested to look more into that, and see, how i could combine them.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. well, um, there's no problem, from the linguistics side. we uh we steal philosophy all the time no problem. um, so i would guess find out from, the philosophy side, uh what they think about          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          empiricism.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm. and then, i was also considering, doing separate, doing something separate for each. and i'm not sure if i started that this summer because i won't be starting my philosophy thesis until winter.          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think it </OVERLAP1>
          would be more fun to see if you could          <OVERLAP1> put it together </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> combine the two? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          after all you know you're not there's not two of you.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah.            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you may be </OVERLAP1>
          getting a double degree, uh but you don't have two brains. it all goes to the same place. so uh, i i'd say your task in fact is to integrate it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... uh i'll start talking to, some people in the philosophy department          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and see what i can do.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. fi- find somebody that uh that you seem to click with that's interested in the ideas and that, that y- you're interested in their ideas and uh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh and i found the name of the new, professor of          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          the philosophy of language Jason Stanley?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. there we go. uh, Jason Stanley okay i could do a web search and find out his publications. but um, probably be just as easy to wait till fall and uh, find          <OVERLAP1> out from him. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> he'll tell me about it </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          great, and so are you signed up for his class? a class with him?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually he's just teaching, the honors intro, for this fall. and then i think winter he'll start teaching more, upper level philosophy of language classes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay is he uh, is he brand new P-H-D assistant professor or is he uh tenured? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> believe he's tenured. he,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> he's been </OVERLAP1>
          teaching at Cornell for a while,          <OVERLAP1> so. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> alright </OVERLAP1>
          well in that case he, he might be looking for uh for students. uh... well, you could do worse than go up and introduce yourself and,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> find out, </OVERLAP1>
          what he's interested in.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> definitely.          <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          as soon as he ge- i think he gets here this fall. he still hasn't moved from,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> cool </U2>
          Ithaca yet so. great.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so, then, you got subjects? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i have an idea of subjects. i'll start contacting the people who, the... girl i know who's living in Switzerland for the summer. now for Spanish, i have some contacts in Ecuador, and some in Bolivia </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> let me see...          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i'm not sure </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i have </OVERLAP1>
          some in Mexico          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and uh no those are Brazil that wouldn't work. um... lemme work on it. oh you kno- n- there are a number of other people around that have, have uh have contacts though. you could uh, you could put a um, um a message out to you know the linguistics faculty, say you know i, i would like to be able to talk to, or to do a little experiment, uh, via email, with um native speakers of the following languages. uh if you happen to know of any that you you wouldn't mind me sending a little questionnaire to, just uh send their email.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          what kind of response rate are you looking for? that's gonna be the issue. they're not there and they're not taking your course you know so.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah well the last time, we had twelve native speakers of English and twelve non-native. and, we really only carried out the research for, a week and a half two weeks, um, since it was a group project and, we did have kinda short notice, we didn't really have the time, to get, that many, participants but, i think, the fact that in that short of an amount of time that many people replied, a lot of people replied the next day i think it's because email is, not invasive it gets there quickly          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and it comes back right away        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. nobody can tell whether you've seen it and if you wanna ignore it you can ignore it and yeah.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          that makes sense. um, alright so i guess you just keep going until you get an adequate response rate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. and i really_ i don't even know what to expect, for that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. well, how many, you gotta have this statistically significant size, right? what kind of end are you looking for ideally in terms of responses? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> ideally? i would like, twenty-five from each group, and          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> twenty-five each language? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> then i could end up with, </OVERLAP1>
          yeah, a hundred speakers.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... alright... aw that, doesn't seem that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> doesn't seem too, huge. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it would be like too difficult, </OVERLAP1>
          no. huh'uh. and they all getting the same variants on the same questionnaire, everything's in English, you're not gonna do the translation task, uh, there's only those two tasks, you can, randomize it without any difficulty, uh yeah. and then yes i would say, that's a pretty simple protocol. um, have you, looked into, what, statistical tools you're planning to get out of this? i mean to to use with it?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i haven't looked at that yet. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i did some psych research and used, S-P-S-S to find statistical significance, so i'm familiar, with it. i would like to take, Stats four-oh-two though,          <OVERLAP1> maybe this summer? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          well when you get results, um, you can always go over to the stat lab, and uh ask to talk to a consultant.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and um, they'll give you a a clue on, various things. yeah lemme see... yeah i think most things in this are pretty independent. and there's... yeah i think there's a number of things you could do. okay. and they might be able to think of something, really fancy that uh, because of the way it's set up. in fact, it might not hurt to take, your um, your current, instrument, over there, and have somebody just take a look at it, and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          ask what kinds of problems there might be with it...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. i'll do that. then, next week same time? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. great. and          <OVERLAP1> i'll find those books. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. moving right </OVERLAP1>
