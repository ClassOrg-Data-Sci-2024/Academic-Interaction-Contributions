         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> have </OVERLAP1>
          s- at least seventy-three first cousins?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i don't think </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think think (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          i have seventy-three (siblings.) exactly.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well then i'll come up with          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (wow) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> another </OVERLAP1>
          one. but that's my example. at the last count which is about three years ago i had seventy-three first cousins, they breed like          <OVERLAP1> rabbits </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> wow </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so who knows how many i have now. and only one that i know of has died. so, i know i have at least three new ones but i don't know most of them, so i don't know what kids they have,          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so, there we go. today's this week's group building goal can't really apply in group, and that is i would like when you guys pass each other outside of group, for you to feel comfortable saying hello to one another and addressing each other by name if appropriate. and if you do have the opportunity to have such an occasion in which you can do that i would like to hear about it just for the uplifting (so that,) i can say nah nah nah nah boo boo to the powers that be. saying that we don't provide a well developed atmosphere, bah humbug. so, alrighty then, okay we're also starting something a little new this week. um, it occurred to me yesterday, like no one had anything they really wanted to talk about we did concepts for a little while and then they were like well we'll let's just work on the, the things. and it really didn't seem to me to be a good use of time to just sit down and look at the course pack and work on it. um, cuz that's something you guys can do on your own          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          if you need to work with other people it's something that, hopefully you guys can contact each other you can use our group email list, um, and you guys can do that on your own too. i think it would be a better use of our group time while you have this many minds in one spot to work on concepts.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          but i understand that the problems are good, examples of concepts so i would like to try to split it down the middle,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and spend about half the time working on like concepts, kind of try to hash things out like when we_ i don't know if like the tables and charts and that kind of thing are helpful to you guys, or like the day_ i don't know who was here the that day we divided up, different kinds of reactions and had people teach them.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i liked that. </U2>
          but that kind of thing just a, hearing it one more time is never bad. so that's that's the only thing and um, i have gotten some feedback from a couple of people over email and i really like that this is you guys's group not mine. um i like knowing what you like and don't like and what you'd like to change, so if anyone has comments please feel free to send them to me, i won't ever like be like oh, well you know... Liam thinks that,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it's stupid when we do, so we won't do that i          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> wouldn't </OVERLAP1>
          do that. okay, so, i would like to go around and do the icebreaker first, and i don't wanna do it by attendance we'll do it, the questions by attendance so go ahead Andy.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, what was it? chapter four when they were talking about, when a carbon is attacked when, like there's a certain amount of area, cuz it's tertiary, and it comes to attack like this          <EVENT DESC="GESTURES WITH HANDS"></EVENT>          and like it can't get in because it gets blocked out,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          so maybe between the C that's coming towards us and the carbon that is attached to the bromine, there's too much of that tertiary area that's taken up as opposed to the opposite side. so that's where it would attack.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well,          <EVENT DESC=":06 PAUSE WHILE S2 WALKS TO BOARD"></EVENT>          the way i look at it is you're gonna have a double bond between here and ignore the hydrogen beta-hydrogen uh, bromine. and so you're gonna have a C-H-three going out and a hydrogen coming in and vice versa here, so it's gonna look something like this.          <EVENT DESC=":05 PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          if this is like the planar view (you know) looking right down on it          <EVENT DESC=":17 PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and the ones in the front correspond to the wedges and the ones in the back, correspond to the dots. so that's why i was saying, well it'd be, E because these are          <OVERLAP1> they're on (opposite sides) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it's just because </OVERLAP1>
          one is on a wedge and one is on a dash          <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the only thing i like, </OVERLAP1>
          the only thing i wondered about is, this thing is, it's probably still gonna be like rotating cuz it's a single bond so how can you tell for sure or is it just so instantaneous that it's just gonna like freeze that like that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. couldn't it freeze in any any,          <OVERLAP1> anyway? </OVERLAP1>

          technically you have four options but,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> two </U2>
          i mean if you jus- the way you look at it you only have an E or Z.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i_ alright. let's just say this is a single bond and this is rotating. technically this can come down here so you have these two on the same tide side and this is gonna cohere so then </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but then do you have anti-elimination? like looking at the one where it is still rotating,          <OVERLAP1> how many options </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that'd make a l- elimination happen more often right? because, the nucleophile doesn't, i mean doesn't really care to attack it because, it's not as positive because it has the negative, um, solvent around it right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so we're so we're saying that by having polar solvents around a positive, carbon          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> carbon </U2>
          is gonna make the charge less, strong it's gonna be more stable.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          does that make sense? we've got all these like, the negative          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          it's so like if instead if it was in a very s- polar solvent then it'd probably be more likely to be elimination right? if it was a          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes yes </OVERLAP2>

          so like during our concept part. then as we get closer to the exam we'll make sure we leave more and more time for, specific questions, um but my my goal and agenda, would be to really hit this chart this time and then make sure i write down to do nucleophiles next time.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then the beta-carbon's gonna be the one that's the most substituted. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right it's gonna work with_          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it's gonna want (to be sure) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if there're more than one </OVERLAP1>
          beta-carbons, it's gonna work with the beta-carbon that's the most substitute like here there are two beta-carbons,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          there's one on the left and one below it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and it's gon- it has to pick one of those beta-carbons and it'll pick the one that the most substitute. cuz that'll be the most stable, way to make a double bond.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so what kind of, which one of these do you want a primary for? the subs- or wait, the one, the S-N,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (one or) an S-N-two </U2>
          S-N-two, you want, to have, does the other_ do the other ones matter?        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> can you explain why, it is with </OVERLAP1>
          S-N-two?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because it's less crowded and then the nucleophile is able to get in there easy.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          yeah it's eable- aisi- ah able to get in there          <OVERLAP1> more easily. </OVERLAP1>

          which i guess which, what she was saying was, the earlier example i told you where there was something tertiary,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and if it was a bulky base it was just bulky, and so it couldn't, (connect or something.)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so basically, if,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's            <OVERLAP2> just </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whatever </OVERLAP1>
          kind of clothes i have on, if, did you guys ever play in like gym class in elementary school with those Big Bertha Balls?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          they're like eight people wide?        </U1>

          like it'll be hard for me to tie a a Big Bertha Ball to my waist and walk around with it.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          just gonna have difficulty getting in there, it has nothing to do with what kinda state i'm in it's just huge. and so this is the same thing. and so if i have on great big bulky clothes and my Hammer pants and a great big fluffy jacket is it gonna be even easier for it or even harder?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> harder </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. even harder. so it's gonna want big bumpy bases, are gonna want either, lowest like primary carbons,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          or,        </U1>

          that's fine        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so if i'm in like pretty normal mainstream, not taking up a lotta space clothes, so i'm a primary carbon.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          right? we're as skinny as we can possibly be, it's all hydrogens. am, i going, to want to be S-N-one or S-N-two?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the nucleophile can fit right there,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah okay </U2>
          and so if i have on the Hammer pants and the, big poofy round inflatable jacket am i gonna favor S-N-one or S-N-two? so i'm a tertiary carbon,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-N-one </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. does this make sense?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          and then this is complete and so, basically we can figure out tertiary and primary,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          those aren't hard,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> those are easy </U2>
          where it's wishy-washy is secondary.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so our big questions really fall on the secondary.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and that's where we can we_ i mean you can look at it and say so okay i have on Hammer pants but a pretty thin jacket.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          it's it's really hard to say so that's when it's important to look at the nucleophile.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          that's why they have secondary carbon, cuz it's important to look at the          <OVERLAP1> nucleophile. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so bulky </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if i'm if i'm a primary carbon, i'm real skinny, i'm you, it really doesn't matter like, we can decide whether or not i'm gonna more likely be S-N-one or S-N-two. it's pretty clear cut right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, which, the carbon itself? like </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right it it w- it's reasonably easy to predict if it's gonna be more towards the twos or more towards the ones. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how is that easier to predict?          <OVERLAP1> i guess </OVERLAP1>

          for things to hit me. am i more likely to let go of this arm, beforehand or to wait until something hits me in the stomach?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> am i more </OVERLAP1>
          likely to be S-N-one or S-N-two?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-N-two </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so wait. (for something) </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'll i'll most likely          <OVERLAP1> wait for something </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, the one without </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          to come at me on the other side.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay yeah </U2>
          if, i'm huge and big and puffy, i'm a tertiary carbon,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          these are umbrellas, i've got umbrellas on my hands and my feet, am i going to more likely want to get rid of my arm first, or wait until something tries to hit me in the stomach?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> get rid of your arm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right cuz something's gonna have a really hard time hitting me in the stomach i'll never get anywhere.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
         <OVERLAP1> so that's why it's S-N-one </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so, ch- p- f- </OVERLAP1>
          primary's pretty clear, to us and tertiary's pretty clear.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          secondary, if i have_ secondary's attached to two carbons right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so i have an umbrella in both my hands but my feet are still_ my legs are still pretty skinny, it's it's a little hard to say. right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> kinda content both ways </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, kinda wishy-washy. so in order to figure out which one's more more likely we have to look at the nucleophile what's trying to hit me. if what's trying to hit me is,          <EVENT DESC=":05 PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          a C-N bullet,          <EVENT WHO="S6" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          we call these bullets because they're long and they're kind of pointed on the end, and they travel insanely fast.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and they always hit things. cuz this is just, a really awesome, nucleophile.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so if i'm secondary i'm not really sure if i want to do S-N-one or S-N-two and a C-N bullet comes at me what am i gonna more likely do?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-N-two </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-N-two yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, </OVERLAP1>
          so let's say,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you don't wanna </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> there isn't any S-N-two, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you're just lazy you don't wanna get rid of your          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (arms,) </OVERLAP1>
          just let it hit you.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it's so much easier.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i do have T-But-O. and this is my very favorite nucleophile ever and we can discuss why sometime if you really want to it's a whole environmental thing. this thing's          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          yeah big its got three umbrellas of it's own, and this is the, part that wants to hit my stomach. so i've got two umbrellas in an attempt to block it and it's the size of a Big Bertha Ball, am i gonna tend towards S-N-one or S-N-two?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-N-one. oh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah you're right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> does that make sense? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz i'm gonna need to do this          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="DEMONSTRATES PHYSICALLY"></EVENT>          so that i turn out planar cuz right now it's a lot easier for you guys to roll a Big Bertha Ball and hit me.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          without it hitting one of my, uh appendages, than if i'm like this,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          it's gonna be a lot harder for you guys to hit me with a Big Bertha Ball.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          if you're trying to roll it at me (at the study group later day.) so does that make sense?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's bulky bases versus, small, or nucleophiles versus small nucleophiles. so that's why they ask you about secondary carbons, cuz we can figure out primary and tertiary,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i w- this is something i wanna go over more next time so we will talk about this, more later. but that's the idea behind it that's why they write secondary.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so does what, (Scotty) wrote up there for us make more sense now? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so now, i think we need to, fill some forms out real fast, so that, this can be (xx) go ahead it's all yours. </U1>
