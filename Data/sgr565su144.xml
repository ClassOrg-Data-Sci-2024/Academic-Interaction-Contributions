       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i just didn't, i didn't know if we were like, like in this part          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          i didn't know how to approach the movies and stuff that i've watched, without it being like, i like i did this i was trying to be like Wendy watched this but        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and, </OVERLAP1>
          you know when we're cleaning it up.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          oh, okay i'll read this        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, at the very end this, jumps up into here </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this was mine i don't know if_ um, we had like a really, i got together with Rachel last night at the Fishbowl and um, we, were trying to like write it, and we were trying to go about, starting with, like the l- stuff from lit articles you know from articles and, getting the stereotypes from that but like, it was really hard cuz we, ended up both reading the same article, um, and like i didn't think that the article had a lot of, stereotypes, per say. like it just talked about it, um, e- economic disadvantage in single mothers, um, and like, that's about i- you know like it didn't have, a list of like a whole bunch of different stereotypes. where m- i mean, there're some that we can think of, just from what we know on basic knowledge but not from, our particular article, you know which was kinda hard. so then we just ended up, going through and seeing what we'd found, in the media, kind of and just kind of expand it and give examples, um, and, like she looked up some more articles so hopefully we'll be able to find more stuff. like i don't know it's gonna be hard, or it'll be funny to see how like everyone else wrote theirs compared to everyone else and like, you know cuz it most likely won't fit together,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          perfectly or something like that or like you know what we wrote might be totally different, a totally different like scale or, way that you guys wrote. so, i don't know how we wanted to put it together but, i guess          <OVERLAP1> if we have </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but i </OVERLAP1>
          i think if each, section like if we're basically in three sections, i think if each section is written differently and maybe one or two people can oversee and_ cuz if you guys's summaries ac- really helped me, with the articles like i was able to highlight and then, kinda put it into my own phrasing so that it all flowed together. um, i don't know if two people could maybe do that for the lit review if, if we had like twenty pages available of summary f- from all parts and they could just,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> pick and choose </U2>
          pull together what was the best and,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          make it our paper.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, </U2>
          i don't know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, i don't know you guys can go through that, i'll read this, and see. i mean can you guys ha- like find it difficult to like, start writing it? like to sit down and          <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i </OVERLAP1>
          i i think, i think honestly i had a little bit of an advantage because, cuz i had read everybody else's articles or their summaries at least, and i had some ideas of, other things that had been looked at in the article, and so i took, i took a ton in how i started writing about my movies and things, that i wouldn've, if i hadn'ta done that,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then i used like, Rachel's article had a definition of what a successful, relationship is, and i thought that would be interesting to use because, it just said relationship it didn't say marriage or anything so you could, use it for child parent relationship or, husband wife relationship...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, and then there_ there was times when, some of the stereotypes we, had were like, comparing it to moms, you know which i don't know if that is gonna be like a separate section, or you know how we're gonna, put that all together. so          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so i don't know if you guys wanna        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do you wanna move? a- are you okay          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> we, wrote it together and it's like, </OVERLAP1>
          uh like five pages, so... but it's very rough like          <OVERLAP1> definitely </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, so it's like </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that could </OVERLAP1>
          probably be good like if you guys could do five, and you could do five and i could do a couple and then we'd have a intro and a conclusion,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          we'd be good to go.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think, the length is not even gonna be a problem because like, i wrote three full pages and then just a little tiny bit on the fourth page and that was like, saying the bare minimum you know like i could've said          <OVERLAP1> a lot more </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think </OVERLAP1>
          the length will be fine.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> also,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) that part </OVERLAP1>

          concise.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or something that we found interesting was like we s- it seemed like um, you know how we talked about how, single fathers, who when the mother dies, or when the mother or like, when they're divorced, we um kinda found out that like, um there's m- more communication or like dads are more involved, with their kids when it's um, single or the moms died, and it's more like tension or whatever in, like divorced families. i don't          <OVERLAP1> know if it's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> wait say </OVERLAP1>
          that again        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like you know how okay, you can only have two situations, a widow, single father          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

          and it seems like, you know in cases in like Full House and Two of a Kind like they were always really involved with their kids and wanted to know, you know          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's, that's like definitely in the stereotype like research so it's that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they do </OVERLAP1>
          try to participate and they do try to help with homework a lot of times and they're no more or less likely than like nonresident mothers, to to help with like homework and participate in daily lives.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then we, um, show that how this is revealed in one of the articles, and we talk about how, like cuz in my article it says single fathers tend to worry about losing custody of their children, and how in the media we'll always see like moms will get the custody like in a custody battle they'll always get sole custody. and that shows how like, at least we're arguing that it shows that, you know society feels that men aren't able to take care of their children it's the woman's job. um, and then we go on to talk about it in Liar Liar, um in Save the Last Dance, Big Daddy... um          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          let's see (here.)          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          and we, talk about, um... how we label that single parent fathers um, need support from outside figures. and that's related to society's views, that men you know it's also related to the view that men can't handle kids, and you talk about, talk about Two of a Kind... and that was a r- um i watched a really good episode the other day i it was like the episode where he first gets the nanny, and he was gonna, like he hired her but then he fired her cuz she seemed to          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (yeah) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> lenient </OVERLAP1>
          with the girls, and then he goes up and talks to the girls and they're like, we really love Carrie you know we can talk about girl stuff with her boys clothes makeup blah blah blah, and he realizes that like, you know he needs her and he goes to her apartment and asks her back and he's like, he says um they need you i need you like, and i thought that was definitely, a good example of showing how, men need support from other people. um and we also talk about, Full House, and My Girl, um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          and then we go into saying that... cuz in the article Disneyland Dads, n- d- Disneyland Moms, she talks about how mothers exhibit more nurturing, behaviors, and they take, primary responsibility for their children's day to day needs and have greater intimacy with children than fathers, and fathers_ they're so, like just the basic thing, fathers have a hard time, changing over to being a single father because they're us- so used to being like the breadwinner, like that's all they did so they have a hard time becoming like, the primary caregiver, and like having to deal with all those things that a mom would have to deal with, which we thought was kind of good,          <OVERLAP1> good point to make </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i agree i feel_ i think um, maybe it's like the causes that we have like, incorrect like the (use about) like for instance like the single fathers like the reason they were talking about them being less involved a lotta times is because, they just at first they don't know how to be involved in their kids lives like they haven't          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> been trained </OVERLAP1>
          they've let the mother take over that role.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz society assumes that that's the          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> woman's </OVERLAP1>
          instinct.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so then because he's pretty much been the breadwinner and he's let her do that, like he's let her just kinda control that area, that like when it comes down to it he only knows like to do recreational things with the kids because, that's all, that that's all he knows. or like for mothers' like psychological well-being if you're already making a lot less money than, you know what i mean if you're having trouble like s- financially supporting yourself plus          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you have </OVERLAP1>
          the strain of, like dealing with children and balancing a job then, that could account for why        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> plus, um with dads i mean if moms are generally awarded sole custody like, even if the dads wanna be involved that's harder for them to be involved in the kid's life like,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and i don't        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it's because society like applies that preconceived notion that dads won't be as good as a parent so (like) (xx) almost always award custody to the mom instead. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think with being less involved i think a lotta times society, assumes that the dad doesn't wanna be there.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          where it's just that they don't, or you know that they don't wanna take the time to be involved, but it's like you know it's the breadwinner thing like they don't know how.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz like in the movies i watched where the, the wife died, the father did a really good job as being like the single parent you know what i mean like, he took over that role very well but when it was just when they were just divorced, he still left a lot of things to the          <OVERLAP1> mother to take care of </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well don't you think, </OVERLAP1>
          when the_ don't you think in the movies where a parent died, they always had a super excellent relationship? like they were this          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> loving </OVERLAP1>
          couple and then it was this, travesty that the other parent died, and so of course cuz they had this loving support relationship, of course they were excellent model parents. but then had they been d- like, if they were divorced, there was something like,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> dysfunctional </U2>
          a little off about,          <OVERLAP1> both of them? </OVERLAP1>
