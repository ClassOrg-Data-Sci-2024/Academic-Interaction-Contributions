   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay um, couple things i'm just trying to, tell you what's gonna, go on next week. keep you ahead um, you know that the exam is, coming up again the second exam on the twenty-first. please print out the exam that's in the coursepa- or on the uh, website. you should be able by now to probably do half of it at least okay? um, there's a huge, area of Meselson-Stahl's experiment, that was nonmultiple choice last semester that could help you um, and i think, if you get a head start on it you'll be better off. um, we're gonna be doing the, Sordaria lab on Tuesday. you will probably wanna read ahead, on that um, because he's not gonna be discussing that in lecture prior. and then you'll also have a five-point, assignment, i will probably give you something like, chromosomes are at two-N equals six please draw them in this stage this stage this stage etcetera. okay so that's, one more little five-point assignment that you'll be getting. Thursday you'll have another quiz okay? we wouldn't wanna let you uh, sleep or anything. and that will be over what he does next which, i believe is transcription and translation and will, also be over the Sordaria lab. and today, um we're gonna end with a quiz so you guys will have a chance to ask any questions that you might have and i'm ending with the quiz because, we're gonna do the chromosome dance which i think will help you, for the quiz, prior to that hopefully. but, uh before that, i wanna go over a couple things that you need, before, we actually, start the chromosome dance. and that, involves genetic recombination, and what does recombination mean? if i say, there's recombination, Meagan? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> isn't that when the chromosomes overlap? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> could be that's called what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> crossing over </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, crossing over. and when does that occur? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> meiosis. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> which phase? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> prophase. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> prophase one. </OVERLAP1>
          okay. so you could get crossing over and that would lead to recombination. can you think of another way you can get recombination? something that's not like the parent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mutations? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay mutation. but something naturally occurring with the chromosomes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> a mixture of the, paternal, per- paternal, genes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, good. uh i just wanna illustrate that for you. i'll use the same alleles that we used, on Tuesday.          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"></EVENT>          and let me just say, we've got dad here. and you had, A and B. okay? so i'll just say he's big-A, big-B... let's draw it small. and he mates with mom, who's little-A little-B. okay, these are unreplicated chromosomes or unduplicated. which means they're probably in G-one, they need to go through the S-phase. fertilization occurs. okay and they'll be brought together. and, it's just random, where they're gonna go, okay at this point. because they're unduplicated. okay? once they duplicate, if we're talking about meiosis what happens? okay if they're duplicated, what happens next? in prophase one?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> pairing          <OVERLAP1> of the chromosomes. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mkay. </OVERLAP1>
          homologous chromosomes are going to pair so, i'll just draw them paired          <EVENT DUR=":15" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          okay? and this is just one option, of the way they could be paired. and what i'm trying to show you is that, genetic recombination can occur, through something called independent assortment.          <EVENT DUR=":12" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and that's just a fancy way of saying, random, alignment of chromosomes, at metaphase okay?          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and you should be able to follow this through. if this was, call it, metaphase one, picture anaphase one okay? and you get a cell, and telophase cytokinesis one you'd get a cell with big-A big-B. and you'd have another daughter cell with little-A little-B. if you can follow that through, post-meiosis two,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          okay you should realize that you get four daughter cells, okay that, one would have a big-A big-B, so would the other. and then you'd have two daughter cells that just had little-A little-B in 'em... this is after meiosis two, and, what do you notice about the way they look? these daughter cells.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hap- haploid appearance </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay they're haploid. that was right. and they also look like, the parents, the original, parents. and we call these parentals, for obvious reasons okay.          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          we just get, A B like dad, little-A little-B like mom. so these are called parentals... and there's been no recombination there okay? but equally likely, since this is just the nucleoplasm and these, things are floating around, you could've had, big-A assort with little-B. okay or vice versa.          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          ahh          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          so now post-meiosis two, you'd get something quite different, you'd have a cell with big-A little-B,          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          and little-A big-B... okay. and they look, different from the, parents okay? you could, assign any traits you wanted. but they don't look like either parent and for that reason they're called, recombinants.          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          okay? so, you guys should understand the distinction first of all understand why this is random, okay? just random alignment in this fluid the nucleoplasm, that can't distinguish, who's lining up with who okay? if, independent assortment occurs, it's just as likely that you're gonna get, the same number of parentals as recombinants. okay? why, why do we want recombinants? why is that important? why do we care?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> variation </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, variation and that'll become important for evolution down the road. okay? okay. so that's independent assortment, understand that you can get, recombination through independent assortment. um, alternatively, we could show crossing over okay? and what that would look like, is let's say, you had a, reciprocal exchange between, the A gene on, chromatids two and three okay? what that would look like,          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          would be something like this... Bs, were not involved so they stay the same.          <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and you should be able to follow this through and see, why you wouldn't get, all parentals here. okay so after meiosis two just picture this, you'd end up with four daughter cells          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          one with big-A big-B, little-A big-B, big-A little-B, and little-A little-B, okay. and this would be a parental type. these two would be, recombinants, and that would be a parental. okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          if, crossing over occurs, it doesn't occur all the time, okay? and it h- so far we've just drawn one gene on a chromosome but there are hundreds. so you could picture a crossover at any locus, mkay? it may happen at one locus and not another. so with, crossing over you always get fewer recombinants than you do parentals. okay? with independent assortment it's a fifty-fifty, balance... okay, um any questions on that? this is gonna be real important next week when you start to do genetics problems. okay?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          good? okay. uh, one last thing before we actually, fill in a table that we're gonna, go around the room and discuss. um, sometimes there're errors that occur in meiosis particularly meiosis one okay? and, those errors, may, happen, early, late metaphase. um more particularly anaphase one. okay, when, the chromosomes are supposed to separate, and maybe they don't okay? so if,          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE ERASING"></EVENT>          there's an error,          <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          in meiosis, and i'll just put it in parentheses cuz it's most common in anaphase one... this is called nondisjunction and what it means, is the chromosomes don't separate properly okay? and, nondisjunction the reason i bring this up is because uh there's a table in your book we're gonna fill out next that, mentions nondisjunction. it's most common in meiosis one anaphase one          <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and what that might look like, is let's just say, it's time for anaphase one to occur. you're used to, one A chromosome going, in one direction, the other, the other direction. let's just say, an error occurs. and both As, go to the left side of my cell, and no As go to the right. okay, so, i'd end up, with cells... after, telophase one, that were diploid for the A allele.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          okay so this cell would be diploid for the A allele and you know that's, not what usually happens okay? and this cell would have no A allele. that's called nondisjunction, this cell would die, this cell this cell could persist imagine this being, haploid, okay, undergoing a second meiosis, maybe this is an egg. sperm fertilizes it, dad gives his copy of A, to the egg, and his copy of B, and now, you have a trisomy. mkay? um, you have three copies, of the A chromosome, and many times that's fatal. okay? uh in human situations that's how Down's syndrome comes about. we have three copies, of, the chromosome twenty-one. and those individuals tend to be fine. um, the other two chromosomes thirteen and eighteen that this, more, frequently happens to, those individuals tend, most of them will die before puberty mkay. so, this is nondisjunction, and typically it occurs, during meiosis one. mkay... okay. um before we do, the chromosome dance, in your coursepacks, there's a table          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          that, i'd like you to fill out. um we've already talked, quite extensively about the difference between mitosis meiosis one and meiosis two, now without looking, at your notes, and this should help pretty, extensively for the quiz too. just try to fill in the table. and we'll go around the room, and see how you did. yeah Bryant.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do you happen to have any copies of that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i'll go, i'll go get one though. cuz mine's, mine's filled in and that would be cheating. um, so try to fill these out. i'll go get you a copy and, we'll go around the room. and what i want_ how i want this to run is, let's say Joel says generates two diploid cells from a diploid. and he says meiosis one if that's wrong jump on him, okay and tell him why that's wrong okay? and, you guys, figure it out and let, each other know what's wrong versus me telling you. okay. so try that. i'll be right back. i don't' know if you wanna pause it or not. </U1>
       <EVENT DUR="2:24" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WORKING"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> somebody's in the lost and found.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

          these are still duplicated to chromosomes okay? so don't forget that you start out diploid after meiosis one, you're two haploids, mkay? now you guys need to go through, meiosis two. and so get in, prophase two. uh you are okay. metaphase two... anaphase two.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> separate </U2>

       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> one-N equals two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> one-N could've equal any, one-N could equal ten.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay. </U2>
          okay? um, sperm cells one-N equals twenty-three in humans. okay there're twenty-three different chromosomes in the sperm but there's only one copy of each, okay? so, you started out with forty-six, and after meiosis one, you have two daughter cells that each have twenty-three, different chromosomes.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how many genes are on one, chromosome? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> typically about a hundred. mkay and that's sort of a ball, hundred hundred and fifty, that's kind of a ball park, figure for how many genes are on chromosome. yeah and, and one thing we've done is we've just done unlinked genes, but keep in mind you could have A-B-C-D, that're all linked, and crossing could occur at any point, on the, chromatids. so, you may see crossing over with respect to one locus but not the other, twenty-three. mkay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then N represents the copy of each, chromatid? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> chromosome. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> chromosome. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. don't even use chromatids in this class cuz it'll, confuse you i think more than anything. just know, this a, chromosome, that's unreplicated, this is a chromosome, that is replicated. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. Meagan? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so when we're doing the, the diploid, then, or like just whatever the ploidy, you go by the letters like, so if it's A and A, even whether they're large or small then that's considered like, one kind.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          and that so then like, if you have say you have one chromosome, with a big-A and another one, with a little-A but they're not like, replicated then you would say two, two-N?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but what if it's replicated and you'd be like, a replicated one with As and a replicated with little-As.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> then it's still two-N. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's still two-N? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah okay what's the ploidy of this cell?          <EVENT DUR=":16" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> three-N equals </U1>

          it's just two-N right? there's two of each kind of chromosome. sure there's three different kinds,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          okay? but there's two of each. okay so don't, get that confused. this would be two-N equals what?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> six </OVERLAP1>

          okay? so, ploidy, the N, means, number, of different, chromosomes. if there's one of each, different chromosome, it would be haploid. okay? if there's two of each, different, chromosomes it would be diploid. triploid i'd have to have three of each. and you don't wanna see that. that only happens in plants. usually, and, they live to tell about it. mkay... mkay?

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you inject the mouse </OVERLAP1>
          hm?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the rats right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          mouse whatever.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you inject the mouse with          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> S-cells </U2>
          S what happens?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> they die </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> why? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz they had pathogenic </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> they had a capsule around it </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay. cont- contracts pneumonia and dies.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> basically. </U2>
          okay? mouse plus R-cell does it have a capsule?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no. </OVERLAP1>

          is it virulent does it cause pneumonia?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. does the mouse die with it? </U1>

          heat killed S. what's heat killing do to the S-stain?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> breaks up the capsules </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> breaks open the cap- breaks up the capsule basically destroys the cell wall so it's just naked D-N-A, in solution. and what happens to the mouse? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it lives. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay it lives nothing's wrong with it. so alone, live R didn't kill the mouse. alone, heat-killed S doesn't kill the mouse, why does a combination of the two kill the mouse? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz transformation </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay transformation occurs and what di- what's being transformed to what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the S and R </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> R is transferring to S </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay, so, basically, something from the S is getting into R, transforming it to becoming S, and killing the mouse. did they conclude anything more than that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. okay? and then it took Avery, what'd Avery do? to a purified solution? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> he took the chemicals          <OVERLAP1> from that and made them </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> killed the mouse </OVERLAP1>
          and killed the D-N-A        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay you take D-N-ase, mkay that kills D-N-A. and if D-N-ase wipes out the D-N-A do you see transformation occurring? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. what about protease that kills the protein? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it still transforms </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay. still transforms, and therefore what did, Avery conclude? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the D-N-A was the uh, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> transforming agent </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay, D-N-A is the transforming principle and not protein. and, protein's so much more complex. there're twenty amino acids there're various ways, millions of ways to hook 'em up. so it was disputed, pretty heavily, debated that uh, D-N-A which is much more simple could be, that important for the genetic material. okay. okay?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          good? okay, do you guys need to? ther- it's quiz time so if yo-        </U1>
