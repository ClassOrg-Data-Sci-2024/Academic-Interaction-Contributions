          and, given, if you go all the way up here, that these are the older fishes, these two groups of fish down here, um, are going to be, probably two separate spawnings... probably two separate spawnings. i'm not entirely certain. anyway i've taken the average of these fish here, and if you look at it on a a graph, you can see a fa- an effect which is quite common. um... this is probably the new spawning, and i haven't yet had a chance to put the numbers in, but i think they're about thirty-five. um, but you see this this kind of effect where with time, the growth rate, gets lower. it's very fast to begin with and then it tails off.        </U1>

          tha- the- is- sh- babies at that age are vegetables i tell you. so the the the thing is though that, animals that are very very young grow very very fast. if you think about it, um if uh you have a baby that say, has a birth weight of, four kilograms... yeah... um... alright so it was a hard birth, hard labor,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          alright do three kilograms, okay ladies three kilograms        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> um three kilograms and it doubles in weight so you only have to add three kilograms don't you? but if you add another three kilograms it goes from six to nine kilograms and, the growth rate is obviously a lot lower instead of doubling it's only gone up fifty percent. so one of the things as you get bigger and bigger and bigger, it takes more and more and more, to grow at the same rate. oh, good heavens. um so what you're seeing here is an effect that, although the the the as it gets as they get larger it's simply harder to add on add on material but this is very very typical. fish, typically grow fast when they're young, and also they typically grow fast at the beginnings of seasons. Bluegills and Pumpkinseeds for example will put up th- on their annual growth often in ten to two uh ten days two weeks. trout, will put on their annual growth in just a few weeks in the spring. then that's it for the year.          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          it's when the food is available. so this kind of effect is uh is uh is is quite common with the minnows. and if you took the slope of that which wouldn't really be worthwhile with that number of points you could get the growth rate. okay. so that's_ oh there it is. that's one set of_ do you want to change it? alright. um... now, the other, um thing that we uh um need to look at the growth is i've put the Pumpkinseed data up here. and you can see the same kind of thing the young have grown, um very rapidly and then the uh weight is tailing off and so on. it hasn't reached a maximum. the reason we wanted to get as large a size range as possible is to try and get, um all the way up to the maximum size of the fish, because, when we look at the um growth of fish if you look in your handout, one of the popular models, could i just squidge by here? is this von Bertalanffy equation.          <PAUSE DUR=":12" ></PAUSE>          could you turn the lights off over there? and this simply looks at the size of the fish where it looks at the length at some time, and this is equal to, i'm gonna move in a little while, but uh L max_ yeah i always stand in the way and then uh you know watch the panic it's uh oh sorry. um, okay, first of all we know that this is the maximum size that it can reach this L max. uh but, it hasn't reached that size yet it's discounted with time, and this is a_ so you multiply it one minus some exponential function, for the growth rate and the time. and this is the uh basic form of what's called the von Bertalanffy growth equation, it's probably the most common equation that is used for describing, the size of a fish with time. cuz if you plot the length against time, you get one of these curves, such as uh such as here. um L max is the maximum size it's the asymptotic growth. and with modern computers, you could fit a curve to those data, so that you could actually describe the curve and um get the maximum size and the maximum size is important, as you might expect in managing many fisheries. um,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> how do y- how do you determine maximum size (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> the maximum_ well this is this is the the point um, gimme, wh- wh- y- um, the thing is, maximum size is, i- is rather a nebulous thing and it's rather difficult to determine. yet in many of the models, you're talking about approaching say am- some asymptote. so you, you know where is the asymptote? it's important in defining these models to know where the asymptote is for the the growth models, that are used for ou- for for ou- for p- used throughout fisheries. now if the size range you have that is small, you get something like this, where this is pretty much a straight sort of line, isn't it?          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and if you did a a susti- statistics on that, what you'd probably find was, that, you'd wind up with a straight line going through those data, instead of some nice curve that would look like that. this straight line is never gonna reach an asymptote is it? it's just gonna keep going on and on. this is a very very common problem, with the age of, oh, the age, and growth of fishes. and so a, variety of devices described in your coursepack are used to try and clean that up, and one of these is called the fo- the um, Ford Walford method, and in the Ford Walford method, you, plot          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE CHANGING OVERHEAD TRANSPARENCIES"></EVENT>          um the length, at age, T, the length at some age T against the la- age at length T plus one. now, if you reach an asymptote, so that the elder fish isn't growing any more, it never gets any bigger, then you know that the a- the length at T plus one is equal to exactly the same, the length at age T isn't it? you with me? if you go an asymptote out here, and the thing's reached some maximum age, then the length may be a hundred and forty millimeters in a ten-year Pumpkinseed, yes ten-year Pumpkinseed and the same length in an eleven-year Pumpkinseed, so that as y- they get older and older and older, you get a line of equality where the length of an age is exactly the same as it is a year older. for example, my height has been roughly five-foot-ten now for many many many years. it's still half an inch taller than Timothy.        </U1>

          of the t- an estimate of the maximum length. just a maximum of the uh maximu- uh uh of the length. and, if you're close you get straight lines. if you're f- way out, you get curves. and what you now do is you put in numbers here, until you get the straightest possible looking line. and that gives you the maximum length and the slope will give you the growth rate. these are the kinds of things that people do, um this is the kind of thing that fisheries wars are based on, okay? um and this is these are methods to try and deal with some realities of the data, to try and find out maximum lengths now a hundred and ninety-eight was pretty close to two hundred, and you see this is quite a nice straight line. the others are curved, or wander around on all over the place. with those with no- ge- with an estimate of the maximum length and two hundred millimeters is pretty good, is pretty good even for our data, you can then plug that in to the, um von Bertalanffy equation, and you can get the slope of this line, and that will give you the value of K the growth rate and you get your, your uh growth equation. uh sorry e- this is um the K, in here. all we're trying to do, is take real-world data, and fit the models to it, such that we can make predictions about growth rate, but more important we can begin to put them into, the kinds of models that are used for managing fisheries, so that you can predict fecundity, survivorship and uh elements such as that. but what i want to show you, really as much as anything else, is that, um, there's an awful lot of guesswork involved, and we can start off with nice hard numbers, the things we measured, right? easy, no doubt, and everybody knew the ages, really accurately right? no question in reading the scales, dead easy. Matt you look skeptical. okay. the data are fairly good, the data are fairly hard, but, management, management decisions, are often made on remarkably incomplete data. okay remarkably incomplete data. and the kinds of processes that we've gone through, with uh with this, now with that incomplete data, you still have to make decisions. compared to management, compared to building policy, science is remarkably easy... science is dea- de- is dea- dealing with hard numbers in many respects um yeah sure there's always uncertainty and so on. but when you're making management decisions and you're sending people to war who's seen Private Ryan? yeah um and those kinds of things, you have incredibly uncertain information, to base ba- to base your predictions on to base your decisions. now that uncertainty, does two things for you. first of all it should keep you humble. but the second thing is it leaves plenty of wiggle room for interests who say don't want to make a change they don't want to conserve organisms and that kind of thing. the real world then of where you apply the data, which_ the hard-won data but the data that was relatively easy to get, okay? the real world of where you apply that, is extremely challenging. and yet it's absolutely vital as scientists if you want to move into the policy kinds of areas or to have an impact in those kinds of areas, that you, understand, how much you can predict and where the risks are, and ideally, you try and give, the policy people and these kinds of things, scenarios. say okay, this is my best guess. if i'm wrong by this much, these are the consequences. if i'm wrong by this much, these are the consequences. okay? so... having gone through this in uh the- these these procedures here it's gonna be the same for doctors you never have complete knowledge. you have to decide whether to treat someone with a potentially lethal drug, with incomplete data... hmm hmm. okay. so. i wanted to illustrate the process and what you can do with the data, but i also wanted to show you the limitations. and i wanted to give you_ to leave you today and we're gonna finish right now, with i hope a lot more respect for the problems that the manager has to face, and the problems that the person who is trying to design policies for a better world, has to face. and of course it comes back to your obligation, to give them the best data and the best information that's possible. alright? any questions...?        </U1>
