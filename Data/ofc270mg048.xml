   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> two and one are independent of each other,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but, and s- but how does that correlate with three?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it doesn't matter. basically in this case three doesn't matter you don't use rule w- one and two, to see that node two is indepen- node one is inde- and node two are independent. so it doesn't correlate to rule three. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so knowing, you could have said knowing three or five and you'd still get the same result, that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you could have said </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> one is independent </OVERLAP1>
          of two        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you could have said knowing nothing even, that node one is independent of node two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (independent) node one is,          <OVERLAP1> i guess </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          i don't understand the table.          <OVERLAP1> (how does that say) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay so this </OVERLAP1>
          is evidence so, here the only grayish gray um node is three so the only evidence is node three. here the only evidence is node four.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right i see that but            <OVERLAP2> independent of </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so down here, </OVERLAP1>
          so, node two was like the punched-in-stomach in the homework, so basically it's saying,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i haven't read through all the          <OVERLAP1> homework </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if you </OVERLAP1>
          have evid- oh okay so this is task two. basically it's saying say you know um um, you have a bunch of causes of abdominal pain in the homework. so one of them is punched-in-stomach. and so the idea is that you um want to see all the things that are independent of punched-in-stomach. so, i was trying to use that analogy but we'll just go back to numbers for now. so what this is saying is that you wanna look to see what's independent of node two. so to do that you say let node two be part of group X.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          what else is part of group X? um and what else is part of group Y? and in some cases if there's nothing independent of node two then that means everything is in group X. there may not be a group Y. so um... if you know node three then then this turns gray and you look at the network as if this is evidence and everything else is not evidence. so, you first start at node two and you follow all the paths going out of node two or coming into node two to see what all's connected and what's not. and you use these three rules, to see where things aren't connected. obviously if there's no line there then then_ say say like if node two and four weren't connected, then obviously two and eight would be separate from everything else. and that's that's an unspoken rule that's not written down. but, in this case, you're effectively providing a break, by having node one and two, follow rule three. so what this is saying is that the probability_ knowing the probability of node two is not going to affect the probability of node one that's what these rules are saying.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but            <OVERLAP2> why </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> given </OVERLAP1>
          that you don't know anything about node four, or any of its descendants.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay that's why three isn't included just because since you_ it's evidence.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          it's          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so yeah so i mean </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not really affected </OVERLAP1>
          by anything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right because you you already know it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> doesn't </OVERLAP1>
          the fact that you know three, remove five as evidence? i mean three is evidence so that removes five so why is_ why do you even have to include five there?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so the the table i- i- is saying that node two_ things that are independent of node two are node one and node five.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so node one is independent of node two node five is independent of node two.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          and so node one is independent of node two only by rule three because of this um, coming into node four, um node two and one coming into node four, node five is independent of node two by two different rules so you could either look at node five being independent of node two because this chain is broken by knowing node three, or you could look at node five being independent of node two by this third rule.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> now i didn't understand your reasoning for if this, using node one, chain is broken here but that's between five and one how does it relate          <OVERLAP1> five and two? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right but the the idea </OVERLAP1>
          is that, you could have this network look any way that it wanted to if its only connection to node one_ to node five was through node one, i mean you try to look and envision yourself following paths,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          through the network        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so two could be anywhere in this          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> blob </OVERLAP1>
          down here and it would still be by rule        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so two could be where node four is obviously at that point node one would not be independent. with node four.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          or which_ but node three still breaks five off from the rest of the network.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          because          <OVERLAP1> (you know i-) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that's just </OVERLAP1>
          because, just since you put two in here that, that you're saying what's independent of two that you had to use three or one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so you have to choose. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay cuz two and eight could be switched and it would be the same.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm... okay so um why don't you ask me about specific entries          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh </U2>
          in here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how about uh evidence four, so is one and seven independent? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, one and seven </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (exercise) one </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so this is just a couple of, entries in there </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i'm no- this is not complete. um the idea was is that i was giving examples of all of it so, one and seven is analogous to two and six, and two and seven. because again it's the chain. so the chain two-four-six and two-four-seven is exactly the same um, separation-wise as          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> they're both independent? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> one-four-seven </OVERLAP1>
          and one-four-six.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so like five you're looking at like this? and like one of these? five and si- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so for five and six?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          yeah so i'm going up, the chain here,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          saying okay well five is connected to three which is connected to one, and so then i'm looking at one at that point and saying how is one connected to these? and one is separated from seven and six because you have node four as          <OVERLAP1> evidence. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          so that means all of these_ since this breaks the chain          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          would be independent of that but then since this is one thing all of these are independent          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          of that          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that's one of the reasons i didn't put it all in the          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> table </OVERLAP1>
          so... alright what else?        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so an example of this s- s- second rule i mean the second rule probably is the easiest one to look at cuz you have the, the f- the the four-six-seven type of relationship which just says if you know if you know node four, then um it breaks it breaks things off so here you have six is independent of everything. so six is independent of seven by rule two. and six is independent of everything else by rule one. i wrote rule one there but it's_ when it's all it's probably more than one rule so six is independent of seven by rule two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>

          what i would_ what i do is_ i just want to make sure is that, uh          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          (xx) sunset um no-accident, and i just do the_ (a little bit similar like) part A.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          have to do all the different combinations of          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but but here, um i mean part A we don't know, uh this          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> happen </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> so it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you might expect the calculation for part B to be a bit shorter.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> uh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because it's true. </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> for </OVERLAP1>
          part A you had to do all the possible combinations you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> uh huh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> had </OVERLAP1>
          to do both when not-accident was true and when no-accident was false.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah but but i mean here because uh if this true, uh, that's_ i mean even in part A this true is in- independent right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm they're not independent. how ho- why are they independent? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uh (lemme see.) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean so          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> th- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> talking </OVERLAP1>
          D-separation-wise they're not independent because you don't know on-time or healthy. so, uh j- speaking in here again you have these chains          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          you have two of the chains.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah i mean in part A we need to combine these two into one node          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then calculate the uh the probability of of of sunset,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and in part B and here we, uh,          <OVERLAP1> plus plus build a </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah so you build a </OVERLAP1>
          bigger table.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah plus plus you uh the, uh, th- in, the conditional probability of sunset and the con- ah given the no-acc- acci- uh accident is true. so just pursue this probability right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah mhm </U2>
          and... and that's          <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you already have this right? so this wasn't the complete equation right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          was just a small part of it.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> and (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you had </OVERLAP1>
          how many terms did you have?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> four and also, i had four </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you had four or          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> mm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> did </OVERLAP1>
          you have eight?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> four, i mean </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah and probability of sunset and the conditionals i mean theory is that we should write a true-false and false-true or false-false.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          cuz here we have written now that is true right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well for part B yeah for part A you had more than four right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uh in part A you mean we have, uh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz you don't know anything about the network in part A right? you're just          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> finding </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah but in part A we already combined these t- two into single node, first          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> part A uh huh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we do </OVERLAP1>
          is_ in part A (the) first we do is to combine these two in into one node          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then after that we do uh still i think for, i mean still for        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay well so you have to t- handle the case of both no-accident and ac- and not-no-accident. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah yeah.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          because first we do consider the no-accident of have accident to combine these two node, we already c- already uh uh considered the batch of the no-accident, true or false and then they are          <OVERLAP1> n- n- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay so how </OVERLAP1>
          big is your table when you make this one?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> for when you combine the two nodes how          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> uh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> big is your </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> eight. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. that's what i wanted to hear.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          yeah.        </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="S6" DESC=":58 BACKGROUND CONVERSATION BETWEEN S6 AND S5"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so i have eight and then but here i mean for calculating probability of sunset, it's still four.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          y- if we combine into single node and then we we pursue this uh probability and then the rest, but i mean for part B here, we already know that's a true, and i see they true to to to get this uh the probability of O and the conditional node,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          (that's all that's here) and if this true is          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          true it become          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yep </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> independent. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so we can (vary) this to get this result,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          my question is_ i know_ my (intuition) is it it seems correct but i want to make sure that the the uh the (query here i used) is correct. because i mean here is_ we want to_ getting us this this probability        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (you don't what )          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uh </U2>
          (you don't)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> this is what i what i want to get right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
          question we ask asks probability of sunset and the condition of no-accident.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then, um this value this probability is sunset and the condition of uh this          <OVERLAP1> true and this true </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> on-time and healthy </OVERLAP2>
            uh huh          </U2>
          right? and so,          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> times </OVERLAP1>

          we have also get this probability so, my question is this (query) used is correct or no?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that s-          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> i mean </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah i mean, is this is correct or not i mean here it's, equal to          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          um (that) (xx) (times) (xx)        </U1>

          oh okay, yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay that's what i was trying to get you to say the the the first calculation you use two times as many terms cuz you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yep </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah. the trouble is there are no i mean in mathematics there are no uh (restrict) and approve that this if this is correct. i just think intuitively that correct but i'm not very sure so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, yeah yeah.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so it's </U2>
          yeah i think if you worked out all the and-relationships that          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it </OVERLAP1>
          would it would you would find that this this chaining works          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          because um...          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          you're just working your way dependency-wise up the up the links, so once you get to the top there y- y- you're you're done so you have once for each level in the,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah so </U2>

          correctly. they've got this backwards (in the denominator) don't they...? it should be probability_ when you have a probability of A given B and C, it's a probability of C given A and B times the probability of A given B, over the probability of B given C. they've written it as C given B.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm. </U2>

          correct. by the rule three in the book.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uh huh uh huh yeah i can understand this one but you can but when this evidence is given this one and this one and (xx) dependent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> they are dependent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> be- because this one and this one are dependent          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so do you understand why this one and that one are dependent?          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uh huh. </U2>
          okay so if this one and this one are dependent          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          then the way it affects this one is that say you had this as evidence,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          now, that affects the probability of this one, because these two are dependent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm and how about this one? this one and this one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> they'll be they'll be dependent als- well no no no. i- if you know this is evidence then okay. </U1>

       <EVENT DESC="BACKGROUND CONVERSATION NEXT :60"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. yeah then these are dependent also because this is dependent through this one, through this one and then to that one. so          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> i want to know </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i want to know thi- it i- this node is dependent to this one?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U2>
          this one this node is also dependent and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          one is also dependent          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          one is also dependent          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh huh </U2>
          oh.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i mean th- th- the way to do this is to follow chains through the network. um so when you have this as evidence now you have a chain that goes from there to there.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          and so now anything that's connected to this node,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          can follow the same chain.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> um </U2>
          so this one is connected to this one and then that's connected to this one and then that one's connected to that one. so you've effectively created a single chain of dependency.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> um if uh i want to know the dependence property's transitive, i mean A and B are depen- A is dependent to B          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh huh </U2>
          and B is dependent to C then we can say that A is dependent to C right? (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah you should be able to um... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> or i want to know the symmetry property. A is dependent to B and B is dependent to A right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> uh huh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> uh huh </OVERLAP1>
          that's that's certainly          <OVERLAP1> true. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          is true?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh huh </U2>
          how about this? transitive          <OVERLAP1> (is true) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i'm tempted </OVERLAP1>
          to say that it is true, um i haven't seen, a proof of it so i hesitate to say that i          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> oh yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> know that it's </OVERLAP1>
          true. um,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          i think that it's true but the way you would know if it's true is by taking those three rules and proving that it's true and i haven't seen that done.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          cuz those three rules are just kind of given to us,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          so there might be some strange combination,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> ah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> of </OVERLAP1>
          those three rules that made this not be the case but i think it's the case.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uh in the in the previous example (in) the discussion section, mhm?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          mhm... mhm,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          (got it)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah uh huh that's good enough. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah there is no, if_ in the case of there is no evidence.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          this one is in- independent and this one right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> those are independent yeah. because of this, this connection the two arrows going to that node and this is, um, so, the reason those two are independent is because, those two arrows going to that node which means that by rule three, if you have two ind- two parents going in like this then the two parents are independent of each other.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          but then once you know this node, they're not independent anymore so then things become more dependent.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          of course the network on the homework is even bigger, and messier.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. um i might_ i actually think (i have a mistake here) um, on this,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you marked me off for not putting f- anything there i think?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well that was yeah the the minus-five was not for that whole_ um,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but i </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          i guess it was cuz that was, oh wait,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz i have (xx) </U2>
          new operator huh, this must have been graded when i was asleep.        </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> okay i don't know if </OVERLAP1>
          it's correct          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>

          see. in S Y preconditions that's right. in X Y and on X F, and clear-X and on X Z and on Z X and_ this is this's_ is this clear?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's, plus five?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>

          and then there's one other_ and that that_ thi- i'm happy about this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> alright yeah </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> (cuz) </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it's above ninety (some) so i feel like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i c-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah this this i think you can keep the minus-three but          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

          three is a bit a- i'm not arguing with that.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright. okay. </U2>
          and the other one is this, and i'm uh_ i don't care as much about this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay yeah </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but th- th- that was obviously a mistake </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> n- no this one_ we we just missed </OVERLAP1>
          we missed          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          that so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and and there's sort of_ i didn't know whether to leave the template in or not and i i,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's fine that's fine </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (labeled it) yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          but then the other one          <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (like) </OVERLAP1>
          this is the minus-one okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. i i put in the extra operator like what i used in the U-C POP planner software,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and you_ it looks like you took a point off for using the extra operator and, and i was confused on that because the instructions said use the same operators for the U-C POP that you used in the STRIPS example.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right well the the operator_ U-C POP had this weird property that you had to specify,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          all of the variables as          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> arguments </OVERLAP1>
          to the operator which were um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so actually (xx) i carefully added in those arguments after i'd done this part when i got to the next part, because i was afraid i'd lose points for not having them match.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>
          but but i didn't miss any- my algorithm worked and my use of the tool worked so i think that's sort of_ i don't know that's sort of a bookkeeping thing it's not really my grasp of what's going on or          <OVERLAP1> (something) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, </OVERLAP1>
          no i i know that s- th- so that's why this was minus-one instead of more and this i- (and then I went to) here and started marking things off and          <OVERLAP1> all that because it didn't uh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right but </OVERLAP1>
          but from the instructions said you use the same operators.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it didn't say_ well so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i took that to mean they had to match,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> ah </U2>
          after i'd already done it. so i won't_ i was like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i i understand um, i am feeling generous and so ordinarily i would say oh okay you can have that point but i know that there were two or three other people that did the same thing that lost the one point          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay fine </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and so </OVERLAP1>
          i hesitate to do          <OVERLAP1> that (just to be fair) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay fine </OVERLAP2>
            but if i can get those            <OVERLAP2> other five </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> oh you can have </OVERLAP1>
          the five.          <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>

          now i just wanna clarify, and i don't think this'll take long at all.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

          say it's it's it says here and you can use the noisy-or relation to calculate the conditional probability.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh </U2>
          so that's that's why it was really_        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i- it's a it's a advantage </OVERLAP1>
          to use noisy-or        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah because it's a lot easier to do the calculations. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i see </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and in fact you don't have all the information you need there, to do anything but noisy-or because you don't have all of the combined conditional probabilities. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> well so we we just have to submit like this something like this?          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah mhm </U2>
          okay. and this_ these were given.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          okay. so these two        </U1>

          you should probably use noisy-or for some of those.        </U1>

          just          <OVERLAP1> say </OVERLAP1>

          so        </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> evidence </OVERLAP1>
          is um abdominal-          <OVERLAP1> pain </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> and then w- and then what's          <OVERLAP1> independent of this </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> independent variable </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right well so so in the the D-separation table i was just giving you a whole bunch of different examples.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh </U2>
          but this one it's a lot harder network, to follow everything through but the idea is the same that you just have like some number here and some number there and you wanna see          <OVERLAP1> what's independent. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> and this will be </OVERLAP1>
          this is will be          <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          would be what the answer is. it may or may not be big, i mean you have to trace through the network and see what's independent of different things.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> okay </U2>
          so like starting out i'll give you one answer, which is ordinarily by rule three, which is the one that says if you don't know abdominal pain then the two parent nodes are independent, ordinarily punched-in-stomach and cancer would be independent. but now that you know abdominal pain, rule three doesn't apply anymore, so punched-in-stomach and cancer are dependent so you can't put cancer in this column. right.          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          then like something like this would be independent. right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, i don't know is it?          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uh, no </U2>
          y- y- mean you have to find          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> find </U2>
          one of the rules that make it independent in order for it to be independent. so what rule would make those two independent?          <EVENT WHO="S7" DESC="FLIPPING PAPERS"></EVENT>          you just picked it up, the example (that)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> like here it's like smaller but this is like, a lot bigger </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but the arrows were also pointing in different directions in some cases. so this is a very different network.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> very different from this one </U2>
          yeah. mean it has examples of stuff in it but, i didn't want to give you the same network or else you wouldn't have to do much thinking.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mm. so like... mm.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          how would you how would you go about like uh, (doing 'em over) here? like you have three here have three you can see, see that but like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so if you want you can just redraw things so you can say, you know if this is node two and this is node four, and this is node one, then you could pretend that's node three. right? so i mean you're still ignoring these connections you have to follow those through also, but basically you look through and you say is there a connection from this node to this node? so you first would follow this path and say well, is this a connection or is there something that D-separates those? so you'd say well this doesn't D-separate it because you have this as evidence. and since you don't have allergy as evidence, this by rule two, would be separated only if allergy were evidence. so, there's no way to separate itch from punched-in-stomach using those three rules. if by this path they were separated, then you would need to go up this path, and say are they separated this way? because they're not separated if there's at least one path, that you can follow and say nope this isn't separated nope that isn't separated nope that isn't separated. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh so like go here, match if          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          if it's if it's not_ if it's dependent go back here or like          <OVERLAP1> dependent </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          so keep following all of the dependencies until you get to something that's independent.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i see </U2>
          and if, say if you follow this through and found that this was independent of this, then you would need to try all the other paths too which in this case is through there. so, if this is independent but this is dependent, then this is still_ then there is a dependency between the two so you have to find to see if every path between two nodes is independent. by those D-separations.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh. and and this, this meant uh this and this right? </U1>

          so that means that that those are both gray shaded areas so, um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> like here i i don't get uh, what what noisy, or is. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so what noisy-or is is you are, approximating... um, get get these again, get these off the web page. that is what that email was about. um. so noisy-or is basically when you g- are given, probabilities only in terms of one of the causes, you try to have some way to combine them. so, what this is saying is, would it make sense          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> to model </U2>
          to model abdominal pain as noisy-or because you already have four causes you have          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah </U2>
          allergy stress cancer and punched-in-stomach. so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> you_ i would say yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, why? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> because uh, this uh, depends on one of these four? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so it does depend on one of those four but um... does it make sense to combine the four independently?          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mm </U2>
          well so basically what you're doing here is you're saying, the three causes are independent e- of each other so,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh because these are independent, of each other? </U2>
          that's that's basically what you're saying here is that, um, i have some probability U that this is gonna happen but then i combine that with this one        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> oh so if there was a some connection these the- you wouldn't (have) uh use uh, noisy-or? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you still can,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> you still can? </U2>
          but basically what y- wha- what this_ wha- what they want you to do here is to try to think about, several things one are those four really the only causes of abdominal pain?          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mkay </U2>
          so think that just just          <OVERLAP1> common </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> not </OVERLAP2>

          sense.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          if they're not then you know, maybe noisy-or by itself is not sufficient. maybe you need to add extra things, to get those probabilities. because if you're gonna do this noisy-or computation, you're gonna, pretend like these are the only causes of abdominal pain.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> so so you could still use or, if there was something connection here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i mean you can always use noisy-or because you can ignore everything else because you have these simple tables. but when you have things connected it's harder to consider them to be independent. so in this case um do you have dependencies between the three uh,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> four? </U2>
          three nodes?          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> these these four? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> when you're trying to pair 'em. </OVERLAP1>
          yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> and then see </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> are they independent or dependent? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> looks like they're independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's what it looks like yeah if you don't know abdominal pain. so maybe in this case that wouldn't be a problem for noisy-or. </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> hm? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, you don't have these direct connections then in this network right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah i- it looks like these are independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay, so, that's one of the factors that you might want to consider for noisy-or, and, another one is the fact that you don't know tha- that these four causes are not complete, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> is is          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> noisy-or based on just this two, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i mean all noisy-or is </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> not looking at these? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> so i- if this_ th- it's saying these won't cause_ that these won't cause this?          <OVERLAP1> you can u- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well </OVERLAP1>
          so what it's saying is that those, well those cause allergy but, noisy-or does not, trace back up the tree. i mean it,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> oh noisy or doesn't </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's a very simple </OVERLAP1>
          model it just looks,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah </U2>
          independently at each of its parent nodes and says okay i've_ i have to have these tables for, what the probability is of this node given each of the parents independently. but it doesn't try to put them together, um based on whatever the rest of the the belief network structure is. all it cares about is just this local, model. so that's one of the p- approximations that it makes. and it also_ there's there_ you don't have any information like maybe if you have cause A you know that cause B is not gonna happen or maybe if cause A, doesn't happen you know cause B is not gonna happen. but you don't have any of that information here. so like maybe in this case you have that um, uh let's see maybe if you uh, are not under stress you know that you're not gonna get punched in the stomach. that_ this is just an example, it's_ so if that was the case, then, noisy-or would not work very well,          <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> wa- </OVERLAP1>
          wait if you're under stress you're not        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so if you knew that, when you weren't under stress that you w- also wouldn't get punched in the stomach,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah (okay) </U2>
          then noisy-or would not be a good model because you had a connection          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> okay (xx) </U2>
          between stress and poin- punched in the stomach, which noisy-or doesn't model. because you take_ for noisy or you just take the probabilities of these independently, put them together. so if these nodes are independent, then, that makes sense to put them together like that but if they are dependent, then maybe it doesn't make as much sense to put them together.          <EVENT WHO="S7" DESC="FLIPPING PAPERS"></EVENT>          so basically what that question is for is they want you to read in the textbook everything that it says about noisy-or, ask us in office hours to see how much we'll tell you and then, kind of just write a paragraph that says, noisy-or, will or will not work because blah blah blah. if they are conflicting pieces of information like maybe s- one thing will support the use of noisy-or, and one thing won't support the use of noisy-or, write down everything, that you can think of and say well based on this evidence i would or would not use noisy-or because, there are these reasons. so you have to choose but, there may be, some factors that would allow it to work          <OVERLAP1> and some that wouldn't </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> like like </OVERLAP1>
          like here?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh? </U2>
          you said use noisy noisy-or here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep. mhm... yeah so is that the way the network changes? yeah. mhm.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> okay </U2>
          right. so in this case, the nodes that are coming in to on-time aren't connected to each other. they're independent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> these are independent? </U1>

          um, for the third one there's no way to get, any of these three.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          because there are lots of ways to rewrite this, which i've written out here, and in each one of 'em there's something that i, don't have values for.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is the one that i was looking up. um well i mean so this is an obvious one but, let's see, let's let's see what's available there again. so, you have the probability that E-one and E-two, s- which in this case is equal to the probability of E-one times the probability of E-two cuz they're independent right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so that's equal to, the probability of E-two times the probability of E-one given E-two.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh. i musta missed that (rule.) so are you using probability of A and B equals the probability of A given B (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> talk louder.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          right so, the key here is that you know the independence relation right so you know that the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so, that way you can cancel out, um so you know that that's equal. so the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A. let's see if this helps us here in        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well well now i hafta, hafta rewrite my, original statement. i'm looking for, the probability of H given E-one and E-two.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so it's either in that form or that form or that form.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um... i can rewrite either of these as a probability of, E times... these two are equal.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          these denominators...        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no no no no, no. this is the probability of E-one and this is the probability of E-two, right? if they're independent you          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uh, can you explain a little bit of (uh reasons) </U1>

          um so, the best way to explain this is by examples so what, example do you want me to explain or examples where do you want me to start?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah i mean, okay for number, uh (xx) two and five uh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> two and five? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>

          so, if you imagine here, that node three is the shaded node,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          because it's evidence,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          then, if you go from node five, what you're trying to see is is there a path between node two and node five.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but, there's no paths here, cuz it's it          <OVERLAP1> (you are linkless) </OVERLAP1>

          don't pay attention to the arrows i mean you can go backwards on an arrow if it doesn't get split by one of these rules. so,          <OVERLAP1> here </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> so the </OVERLAP1>

         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          have any paths from two to five.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> not directly, but, the idea is that if node two and node one are dependent, and node one and node five are dependent, then node two and node five are dependent also. because there is a direct path, between them.          <OVERLAP1> it's not direct but there is </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so i mean that you can follow and say node two is dependent on four node four is dependent on node six node six is dependent on whatever's below it. so you can follow a path between node two and node eight,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yeah i understand. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (or whatever) </OVERLAP1>
          and say, that, none of these rules apply so there there's a chain of dependency. so in this case, node two and node five is kind of a bad example because they're way independent. so, in this case you look at node two and you say well, this is the only path between node two and node five. two four one three five. so then you say well okay i'm gonna follow this path. is node two, and node four dependent? yes they are, so keep going,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          is node two and node one dependent, you're gonna hate this grammar,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          node two and node one um, dependent. well the answer is no, because rule three, breaks node two and node one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay so, what, do you mean by path by paths?          <OVERLAP1> i mean, (i was) talking about (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, what i mean by pa- let's- </OVERLAP1>
          let's look at one that is dependent. let's say node four is given as evidence.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          and you're trying to see if node two and node five, are independent of each other.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          okay. so you start at node two and you say well, okay is node two, dependent on node four, yes?          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah. </U2>
          is node two dependent on node one? yes, because rule three doesn't apply anymore. so you can go from node two to node four to node one, and you see that they are dependent on each other.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          which is basically saying, if you know the value of node one, does that affect the probability of node two and the answer is yes, if you know the value of node four also.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          that's what that rule's saying. so now you have that node two and node one are dependent, so now you can keep going, so now you can say well, is node one dependent on node three? yes,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          so that means that node two is dependent on node three.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          so now is node three dependent on node five? yes,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          so that means that node two is dependent on node five.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> alright then, okay, so, so, if when you when you said uh, node two is dependent on node one, which means if you know node one, you will know node two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it doesn't mean you'll know node two it means that that may affect the probability of node two, because when you have these tables you're gonna have_ you might have a table that says node two, um, well, if you know node four, then          <SIC> node's </SIC>
          two's probability, changes whether four is true or false.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so because, say there was a hundred percent probability that node four would be true,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          if node two was true and a zero percent chance of n- if_ of, four being true if two was false so then you know, um tha- tha- if the value of this affects the value of that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so now say, you know the value of four, say it's true, and you also know the value of one, say it's false.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          now say node four, has a probability of zero,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          when node, one and two are both false.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          so if you know node four is true node one's false, then you know node two has to be true.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          so that's how that dependency relationship i- i- that's that's kind of the extreme case of how, you can see that node one or t- and two are related when you know node four.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          so that's why rule three is here. so you can_ similarly you can do the same thing for rules one and two, um, if you know, the value of          <OVERLAP1> node three </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          if you can apply the rule which means, dependent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> ye- w- well if you w- can apply the rule that means it's independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so how about this uh, this one, uh if, given node four,          <OVERLAP1> uh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> given node          <OVERLAP1> four? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> node </OVERLAP1>
          four how about uh one and seven, they are dependent          <OVERLAP1> on (each other) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          they're, well so does it fol- so node four becomes shaded if you know it.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you can apply rule one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can apply rule one.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          what does that tell you?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> they are independent? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> and why, it's not here. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it's not here because i only had spec- if you noticed that i'm i'm only looking at part, this woulda been a huge chart if i'd done everything.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          so i'm only looking to see what's independent of nodes two five and six, because they cover the different areas, of the graph. so i'm looking to see what's independent of node two, what's independent of node          <OVERLAP1> five what's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> okay s- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          independent of six. so for node four, you can say okay what's independent of node five?          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          so, node five's connected to node three, which is connected to node one, so those are all dependent        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so          <OVERLAP1> basically, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          for node five you, uh, you have paths to any node here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> from node five no. because from node five, you connected all the way down to node four,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          but now since you know node four, by, rule one,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          four one and seven are different are are separated right?          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          and one and six are separated. so that means you can't keep going through node four to six and seven, from five. so five is separated from node seven because, when you go five three one, and then four, four separates one from seven so that path doesn't exist anymore.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> how about eight? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so eight, the path is_ does exist there because since you know node four,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          you go five three one four,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          and then ordinarily you would apply rule three, but since you know node four,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          rule three doesn't apply anymore. because you can't know, um, this node in order for these to be separated.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so now, one and two, are dependent, so you can go five three one four two eight. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> one and two are, dependent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. because, the only way they could be independent is if you could apply one of these rules. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay so, this rule is for independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. so now given four one and two are dependent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> th- yeah. uhuh whereas if you didn't know four, one and two would be independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. so given four these two are dependent, but,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          six and seven are independent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right because of rule one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> because rule two, or rule one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> rule ru- well, six and seven are independent of each other but five is independent from six and seven. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> no i mean six and seven are </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. they're independent </U1>

          so, so basically uh i get, i like, from here and i don't have_ i don't need point-three here. (so this is point-three here)          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. mhm </U2>
          yeah. right. so the probability of this one, should be, just a summation of these two?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, um,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> right </U2>
          presuming that you know, no-accident yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> no no no no i mean, this one's not, no-acci- uh, you have accident so not no-as- accident. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but it's true if then          <OVERLAP1> uh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
          probability of on-time and health,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          is the probability of on-time and health given no-accident times the probability of no-accident, plus, the probability of on-time and health, given no-accident times the probability of no-accident. so you're missing some terms in here, so you have to write down that the probability of on-time and health, is equal to this times the probability of no-accident.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> i think both, should be equal, cuz, if you have two like, two say A and B and you say the probability of A given B plus probability A given not-B should be equal to the probability of A. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, but          <OVERLAP1> you have to </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> this should be right, </OVERLAP1>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> why not? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> because you have to, here you're you're saying you're given no-accident, here you're saying you're given no-accident, but, you're not given no-accident,          <EVENT WHO="S9" DESC="SIGHS"></EVENT>          you have some chance of there not being an accident.        </U1>

          i mean th- the point is that you can't have both, an accident and no-accident.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> that's my point, so </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is confusing cuz you're saying not no-accident but oh well. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah. i mean, is this right? is this equations right? </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          the probability of A, is equal to the probability of A          <OVERLAP1> given B </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> times the probability of B </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. it's not. </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="S9" DESC="SIGHS"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i'm writing this down so that you can look at it, and compare them.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          okay. so, why do you need these terms, they're they're effectively weighting terms because, here you you're just saying you're adding the probability of A given B plus the probability of A given not-B.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          and so what this is saying is that this is the probability of A given B, times the probability that you're actually going to be given B.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          plus the probability of A given not-B, times the probability that you're actually going to be given not-B. so the point is that you can't just assume, both B and not-B. which is what you're doing if you don't put in these weighting terms.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> alright. yeah i'll          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

          that make sense? i mean if not then          <OVERLAP1> ask another question, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          i know this one is right          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          yeah and y- you can see mathematically why this isn't equal          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          to that right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah,          <OVERLAP1> uh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz i </OVERLAP1>
          mean, th- the only way this is gonna be equal to that is it's the probability of B is one and the probability of not-B is one. and that's impossible. so, like if you were to know that B is true,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          then the probability of not-B would be zero.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> okay i kn-- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so you would </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> i know what you mean. okay. yeah. alright, so. and...          <EVENT DESC="FLIPPING PAPERS"></EVENT>          in, in task one, uh i can, prove it's sufficient, but how about in case it's it's not s- s-          <OVERLAP1> it's in- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          it's not sufficient          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          if it's insufficient then,          <OVERLAP1> what you should </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> (how do you) (express) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          do is say what extra piece of information you need, in order to get, it, so i mean, you don't have to do a formal proof, to show that it's insufficient,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          but what you would have to do is to say, this is the extra piece of information i need and, i can't get it from the rest of them. and, like, you can explain why, but you don't have to prove,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          that you can't get it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so, if any one of these uh, is sufficient in, part A,          <OVERLAP1> it should be, sufficient </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> if it's, sufficient </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          in part B.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          too          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm.          <OVERLAP1> mhm. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you don't have to prove again.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. cuz in part B what you can say is, it was sufficient i- in part A and i know extra stuff so th- therefore it's gonna be suf- sufficient here. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. and (the) problem,          <EVENT DESC="FLIPPING PAPERS"></EVENT>          noisy-or. if you want to say you can apply nois- noisy-or you have to,          <OVERLAP1> prove the truth-table? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you have to do that. </OVERLAP1>
          prove it? no, you don't have to prove it you have to calculate the values because these are just,          <OVERLAP1> (possibilities) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> yeah i mean, </OVERLAP1>
          y- you you in all of these then you, need to calculate uh, uh, all the probability,          <OVERLAP1> here? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, uhuh. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so, and they say, it's true so you can apply noi-          <OVERLAP1> noisy-or. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well </OVERLAP1>
          so so as far as applying the noisy-or goes, you have to kn- know whether it's good to apply. so like in task four it tells you, you can go off and apply noisy-or so you can just assume that it's okay to do it. for task two,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> uhuh </U2>
          it asks you whether you actually can apply noisy-or. so there you don't have the probability so you can't go and make a table like this.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          in task two what you want to say is, well noisy-or is appropriate because, how the network's set up and what things are in the network so, what i've been telling people is, look at the network and say, are these four causes of abdominal pain, the only possible four causes. if not then you need, something else, that models the fact that, there may be something else that causes abdominal pain. read about noisy-or in the book and it'll tell you something about that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah, i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and </U2>
          okay. if you, if you don't know (about) probability, how can you_ you said you can apply,          <OVERLAP1> noisy-or. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, </OVERLAP1>
          so you would you know you could only apply noisy-or if you knew, these individual probability tables.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah. </U2>
          so what you would have to d- have is um probability of abdominal pain given that punched-in-stomach is true, given that punched-in-stomach is false.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm. but if you have, your individual tables here, you can have the,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you can </OVERLAP1>
          do this but the question is does it make sense to do this.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> what </U2>
          mathematically you can always take these tables and make this, but, say for example        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> no i mean          <OVERLAP1> (maybe it) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> A </OVERLAP1>
          and B were connected. so maybe, say that B could only be true if A was true.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> if, if you can not apply noisy-or, your tables, sh- shouldn't be like these. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. no if you can't apply noisy-or then this doesn't make any sense. this was just an example of the mathematics behind applying noisy-or this is not telling you when you can and when you can't use it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> why not, i mean </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i mean so, this is_ uh there's no commentary here this is just saying these are tables this is what you get if you use noisy-or. but this is not telling you, whether it makes sense to combine these probability tables, using the noisy-or. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but if you cannot use, noisy-or the formula shouldn't,          <OVERLAP1> (be) this </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if you </OVERLAP1>
          can't use nor- noisy-or then, you shouldn't make one of these tables. i mean, the only thing this example was showing you was the math, this wasn't showing you, whether or not you could actually apply noisy-or in this case,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          you can apply noisy-or          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          because i have no knowledge, except that A B and C, are the only things that can cause D, and it appears that A B and C are all independent, and i have these nice probability tables so just given this simple network noisy-or makes sense.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so can i say, uh, if, all of these three nodes are independent, to, each other, then, you can          <OVERLAP1> apply </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          they're independent, and, there is no other cause, for node D, then you should be able to apply noisy-or.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> how about if you have another node D here. can you apply          <OVERLAP1> (to this one?) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well (something) </OVERLAP1>
          E? yeah. it it shouldn't be the same          <OVERLAP1> name. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, if you don't have one of those tables for node E,          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          then there is a specific, um term for that in the book, and, you may or m- noisy-or construction becomes more difficult if you have a node E.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but, you know they are independent. you do- don't have table (rather) you know that this node (are) independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. so you want to leave some of the probability left over for this node E right? but, i mean, so, you should still be able to apply noisy-or but you want to use some of the terminology in the book in that case because, if these aren't the only causes then what does that mean? how can you explain away the fact that you don't have, all of the, all of the causes? so basically just, write a paragraph that says, i can or can't use noisy-or, this is why, and, why being the dependencies, and, what does it mean t- that there may be other causes.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          and the book will tell you something about, how you model, so what you want to do is you want to explain if i use noisy-or for this model, then i have to do, this and that          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          in order to be able          <OVERLAP1> to (u-) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>
          so, if you, if you can use noisy-or you just, make a table.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          if you can not, you have to explain          <OVERLAP1> why. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          you if you can't use noisy-or then, you can't make a table like this so you can't combine these probabilities in that way.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          so, if you can't use noisy-or then you have to have more information as far as like how your network's constructed or what you need to add to your network in order to calculate, the proper dependencies. cuz here you're just guessing.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay. </U2>
          and how the- they connect to each other          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>

          yeah i mean the the reason i want to try it is just because, her answer says that it's sufficient so, this is an answer that she made quickly so, she may have changed her mind by now and said it's insufficient but, this is what i have so, i i don't want to tell you that, you have thought of everything unless, your answer agreed with hers. so, it's i just want to do some math so          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          un- until other people come and show up, lemme uh, so the problem says_ ma- make sure this old version agrees with that. you're given P-H P-E-one H and P-E-two given H. right yeah. mkay.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if it's not evidence          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it should be independent. okay so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. so if that's </OVERLAP1>
          evidence then those two are dependent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> dependent.          <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, these are dependent, these are dependent, these are dependent,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          and, since these feed into here,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          then these would also be, not independent with this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          okay. and then, up here, since this feeds into here, and these feed into here,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          they wouldn't be, independent of this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          and since, now this uh this feeds in here so this affects allergy.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it also affects bad breath.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          so, these two, would also not be independent of this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's correct </U2>
          okay. (Sun hi) came by to correct me.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. so part A (ends the) answer's kind of scary but, it's,          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> not            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          that's right yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. and then, i guess if i'm thinking about it right i should have this, correct i think. but, in in the case where these are both evidence, then these, two would be independent if this is evidence,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so then these would be independent, um, and there's_ so this is blocking i guess,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          uh punched-in-stomach and itch, or eat-apples or eat-fish, um, yeah so these would be, independent of, punched-in-stomach.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. but you have to be careful about the uh the rash one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the rash one right.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          cuz stress goes into there and there's no blocking,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          between there, okay. so rash, but, let's see. but bad breath would, be independent because, or, are these ar- can you go both ways on these arrows or        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what do you mean both ways?          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          you have to use one of the rules for everything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. eat-fish is, independent, of punched-in-stomach. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> via that path yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> which means that bad breath since coming from here would also be independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. but i- they have to be independent on all the paths so now you have that punched-in-stomach via allergy is independent of eat-fish and bad breath. but is, eat-fish independent of punched-in-stom- stomach if you come this way. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> not via rash. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. is it not? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm, not. wait. is this independent of this? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> via rash? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> if you </OVERLAP1>
          ignore the allergy path and just look at the rash path.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, let's see... um, i'd say it would be.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          because, this only goes, that way.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. mhm, mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. okay (then.) um, and, i, worked out, the um, the task four with th- um, the noisy-or,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          and, i wanted to see if i was doing it right cuz i followed what they, did in the book,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah uhuh, that's good </U2>
          um, they l- what they did they took the probability of, say, sunset given, each of these,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and that was, a number and then, you take one minus that number,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then, take there's true y- y- you, well if there's a true here, you count that number,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, mhm </U2>
          and if there's three trues you multiply them.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          and then, you'll end up with this and then you just, subtract one to get this value... subtract this from one, and get        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, okay i w- i woulda thought that you went the other way.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. </U2>
          cuz i mean in class we did the, probability of sunset is equal to the probability of O plus, one minus the prob- one minus probability of O, times the quantity and then we combine those,          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          which i- probably gives you the same thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think is, i think it's exac-          <OVERLAP1> it looks like the same. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah i think it is. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then, okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so and then the one_ i mean it's easy to check the ones that are just individually true because you can just look at the table and say uh          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. (i got it.) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah okay. that sounds right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so, okay. uh... okay, yeah that's gonna be (good) enough. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> thank you. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you ready to get on tape too?          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          ah yes i know_ i remember you because of these dotted lines,          <OVERLAP1> yes </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          yeah. uh, i'm okay on this one though.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay. </U2>
          this is uh, evidence?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah mhm </U2>
          and uh, we're going to see, if any of uh, if any of these nodes are independent of (this.) i know this is uh, dependent          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. mhm. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> this is dependent_ or these should be both dependent on this,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          if given only this evidence.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          but i don't know if this one is, dependent (or not)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well is this one dependent on that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> should be yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. since this one's dependent on that one that one's dependent on that one that one's dependent on that then, it is. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> this is evidence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well so, but but yeah. so th- the point is can you follow a chain, all the way to punched-in-stomach, and so you have that stress, is dependent on punched-in-stomach. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so, so (is) this way? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that one is also. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so i know y- if this, this point R (that if it sends) some nodes (xx) this is one is uh, dependent on this. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that one's dependent on that yeah mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> right. oh this one you mean the arrow, points          <OVERLAP1> (that way not this way also becau-) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well so so the point </OVERLAP1>
          is can you apply any of those three rules, for separating the network into parts.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah i guess so </U2>
          and in this case you can't because you have, dependency that comes from abdominal pain up to stress so you have some sort of evidence about stress, based on abdominal pain evidence.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          the fact that you know abdominal pain changes the probability of stress a bit. since you have that, you can't apply rule three, to separate these,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah alright </U2>
          which is what you would ordinarily apply,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> right, yeah </U2>
          so since you can't apply rule three to separate these, now this is dependent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> this is dependent on what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so this is dependent well so these are dependent on each other,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          but because this is a chain, um, and you don't have all of the evidence about this one, this chain isn't broken. so, midterm depends on stress which depends on abdominal pain. and a-          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> (to b- ) </U2>
          abdominal pain depends on punched-in-stomach. so,          <OVERLAP1> you basically </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> yeah oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          just work your way through and find all of the chains,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> cuz i don't know when it sh- where it bloke broke or where it's it is not </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well if you were_ if you knew stress is evidence,          <OVERLAP1> then uh, then </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> y- oh yeah th- in this case yeah this, this sh- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> midterm would not be connected to abdominal pain if          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          you knew stress is evidence.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> alright. </U2>
          but since you don't know stress, then midterm is dependent on stress which is dependent on abdominal pain.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay but y- in this case these, these two are not </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> those two are not dependent on each other.          <OVERLAP1> well yeah well, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> oh th- they are dependent </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> they are because you're getting evidence          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> cuz they, oh okay </U2>
          from abdominal pain. if you look at rule three then it matters whether the children have evidence or not also.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so basically for this this chain is (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that a guess or have you worked through it,          <OVERLAP1> to see? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. that's that's the case but but i just wanted to make sure you'd work through it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah, so i don't, i'm not sure if this one is dependent on this          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah mhm </U2>
          (xx) so if this,          <OVERLAP1> okay fo- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          i take this one, and these two are (xx) these these two_ let me see_ this is evidence, so, we can apply, yeah this is blocked. right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> why is that blocked? </U1>

          and this is is        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's blocked from there but it's not blocked from here,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> ah </U2>
          so whatever this is cuz i m- see this is rule three again,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          so you have to look back through here, and say        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> why, why it's rule thr- oh rule three said if this is evidence this_ these          <OVERLAP1> then those </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> then those two </OVERLAP1>
          are not blocked.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          these two.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and it          <OVERLAP1> so these (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so you </OVERLAP1>
          have to work through all of the paths so in order to say any of these are independent you have to both work through this path, which allows you to say that they are independent, but then          <OVERLAP1> you have to come back this way also. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> what, oh yeah, this way, yeah. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and you have to decide, well so if rash is dependent on this punched-in-stomach,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> (just w-) </U2>
          then well eat-fish is dependent on it also.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> s- s- </U2>
          so work your way back this way and see if those are dependent also.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> ah, so this one is dependent on this one this one is dependent on this one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. but but well so then the question is... is this one dependent on that one? that's the key is stress dependent on eat-fish? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> stress dependent on eat-fish... (xx) </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> joke, ar-ar. and that's the          <OVERLAP1> key. </OVERLAP1>

          yeah. this is not evidence so this is not broken so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i don't know is it broken? well l- look at this, versus the rules that you have. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> this is this... uh, uh, so r- rule says only when there's two other nodes,          <OVERLAP1> (something like that) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh well </OVERLAP1>
          no that's i- just saying if there are any other nodes down here if you have those as evidence then that, makes it not blocked,          <OVERLAP1> or makes </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but if there's no nodes down there then rule three can still apply.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> oh, okay </U2>
          you just don't know any evidence about any of the nodes down there which is good        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so this, this one is, so this one is blocked?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>

          but i mean you've you figured it out mostly for yourself i just verified so so...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> the the first one is just we say, when we apply, that (xx) that what what's the name of that rule </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> Bayes' rule? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> Bayes' rule and the </U1>

          and then you have to just manipulate things here and there,          <OVERLAP1> to see </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so i figure out only this (makes it.) </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and he's made things </OVERLAP1>
          shaded, yes.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the D-separation was giving me trouble before.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          uh the first one with just that, as evidence,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          there's nothing you can say about anything cuz none of these rules applies really.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> good </U2>
          but my problem is even with the second one in there, if none of these rules applied the first time they're not going to apply        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure they are. you want them to block right so now all of a sudden i mean if you just look locally eat-fish and itch are blocked right by rule one? that doesn't help you much here cuz i didn't wanna tell you the answer.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so is anything else blocked?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the thing that confuses me is, and this confused me in lecture, seeing that sometimes you treated it as if there were an arrow pointing that way and sometimes you didn't. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm, you shouldn't treat it like there's an arrow          <OVERLAP1> pointing that way </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right i </OVERLAP1>
          couldn't say that these two are independent cuz there's no, chain_ well there's no rule one chain going to it, no matter how you        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you don't want a chain if there's no chain that means they're independent. i mean think about it if you had two networks that had no connections between them then those two networks are gonna be i- independent even though none of these rules apply. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but... it just seems like this is going to be </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so think in terms of those three rules still. so,          <OVERLAP1> since you know allergy </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but, with this still </OVERLAP1>
          there, and only one arrow pointing in from here?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i don't see how anyth- this is gonna depend on anything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> how it's going to depend on anything? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you just said everything depended on it.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          cuz, you're supposed to list the stuff that's independent of punched-in-stomach          <OVERLAP1> and you said everything's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> let me rephrase that, </OVERLAP1>
          talking about the independence,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> kay </U2>
          given just this as evidence i don't know, anything about the independence so i can't say, one is independent of the other.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure you do. you know the independence you know this one is not independent of that one, you know this one's not independent of that one. you know that it doesn't matter for this one because you're given that one as evidence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah there are too many double negatives floating around </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so, i think the key here is for me to tell you,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well </U2>
          one of the independents so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no, the key is uh, do it on a different network so i          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well </U2>
          can apply it to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> do you have the example from the web, with you? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um the one you did in class, you mean?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. mhm </U2>
          i didn't really, follow all of that one        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. let's go there so that at least someone will use it.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can run Netscape off here? it wouldn't let me do it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i logged in elsewhere to start it up.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          i logged into Crusty actually which Jeff hates me for, my s- Netscape from Crusty but oh well he won't he won't find it. okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          it's not the fastest in the world.        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":12" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe i answered the first one too hastily without actually knowing </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. you may have gotten lucky on that one but, it is kind of good for you to know because i guarantee you there'll be some of this on the exam because this is one of those fast things that, are good exam questions because, you don't have to do all the calculation.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so... i mean, so this is a simpler network but the idea is, still that, you can apply these three rules to various parts of the network so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i mean the the simplest case is if you know node three then one nodes one and          <OVERLAP1> five are </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> actually </OVERLAP1>
          this isn't representative at all because here          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure it is </U2>
          we've got a bunch of 'em pointing inwards toward          <OVERLAP1> the nodes though </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well here you </OVERLAP1>
          have node one and two that point in to node four.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but they're not, they're not individual nodes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh? well that doesn't matter. i mean if they were individual nodes it would still be the same application of rule three.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          i mean i didn't want to give you something that had the exact same structure as          <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i </OVERLAP1>
          know, i          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i mean the idea is that the rules are applied in the same way. so, here, i mean you can look at the network locally and you can say, um, eat-apples is independent, of the stuff down here, because allergy b- breaks the chain between eat-apples and the stuff          <OVERLAP1> down here </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no but </OVERLAP1>
          these, don't follow rule one because, the arrows are pointing in the wrong direction, these arrows are          <OVERLAP1> pointing this way (here) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no no no but </OVERLAP1>
          you look at it locally, and so basically you're just saying eat-apples is separated from abdominal pain.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, okay </U2>
          and then, the only connection to eat-apples, well ignoring this part the only connection to eat-apples, to the rest of the world is through abdominal pain and since_ i mean so, the idea was that these are sets, X and Y,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and so X and Y can have any number of nodes in them so right like, right here, what this is saying is that nodes one and two, are separate sets. if if you don't know node four.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that, i understand that </U2>
          and so that means that, node three is also independent of two node five is independent of two because, one three and five are members of set X, and two and eight are members          <OVERLAP1> of set Y </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> sure y- </OVERLAP1>
          well yes you can, i mean you can defides, you can define_ divide simple things like P-S-five and midterm, using that rule but you can also divide things using rash right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> these two can be divided </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right and that's the whole network i mean you're dividing, i mean, y- when you know allergy and you know that this connection is broken because you know allergy, then you're also dividing, stuff out based on that right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you mean like, consider it breaking it right there and there? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, mhm. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so this is independent of that          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          since i know this i can't say that this, so this is, a network right here,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but i can't say anything about that because, for the same reason i couldn't say anything about it in part one.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          so there's nothing i can say about that over there        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you can say they're all dependent right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well yeah but          <OVERLAP1> you're asking for </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that's that's something </OVERLAP1>
          to say, y- i mean but that's something to say is the the fact that you're saying all they're all dependent means that, you know something about them        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. so now, since i've worried about all that, i just have this part of the network left.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, this is out also. oh no it's not        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what do you mean it's out? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i was going to say this, is broken here but it's          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          i know this and this are independent but what does that, that doesn't break the dependence of, rash on eat-fish        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah i mean </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh </OVERLAP1>
          and once this is out i can collapse these as one, node right? i mean as one evidence node?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> does that help? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it doesn't. actually yeah it makes this independent of that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean, it makes this dependent, oh no it doesn't cuz that breaks a link too, yeah, it makes this conditionally independent of that.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm yeah mhm </U2>
          because you've got, if these can be collapsed as one and this, i don't have to worry about that arrow going the wrong direction. so that would now_ that's legal right? since i've taken off this part of the network by showing it's, conditionally dependent?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          then i'm just left with one, with one arrow going,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, mhm </U2>
          between these two.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and since there's only one i consider this as one evidence node now, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah that may actually hurt you later but yeah you can do that          <OVERLAP1> for now </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well </OVERLAP1>
          doesn't that now show that, these two are conditionally dependent?          <OVERLAP1> or independent? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> dependent? </OVERLAP1>
          independent yeah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> independent i mean? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but how does that, how does collapsing this hurt me later then? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i do- i don't know that it will i'm just thinking about all the rest of this stuff for example </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean if i've reduced it so that there's only one arrow, combining two evidence          <OVERLAP1> nodes </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well </OVERLAP1>
          so what that means is if y- if you uh, if you collapse these into the same node        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i can't do that with these here, but          <OVERLAP1> since i've pruned this off </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right so so if you </OVERLAP1>
          collapse these_ well but, can you just prune them off if you're actually collapsing these into one node?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well that's (what) i'm saying and since i've showed that, when i broke it here, and then i've showed that these are all conditionally dependent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right right right, but but the point is if you're, actually physic- if if you're making these one node, then that means that the arrows into this one, combined node include this one this one that one that one and that one.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          whereas if you leave them as separate nodes then you only have these two arrows, and these going in.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but if i leave them as two nodes then i can't say that these two are independent by_ or conditionally dependent because of rule (one) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well yes you can </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> why? this arrow is going in the wrong direction </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well no d- all you have to do is to say, that by rule two, this one and that one are independent. because this is part of set X and that's part of set Y. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh the fact that this is an evidence node doesn't change that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. no that doesn't change for these it just changes for all of the things in the center so, can i mark? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> all of these, have to be specifically evidence or not evidence but the ones out here,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          don't matter because this is just, set X, and set Y        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> which could have any number of          <OVERLAP1> evidence or non-evidence </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> which could have any number </OVERLAP1>
          of evidence yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay that's what i didn't understand </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i mean it also matters for these child nodes here if you have evidence of one of the child nodes for rule three then rule three doesn't apply anymore. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, so this is rule two saying that these two are conditionally independent,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so like here since you have this one as evidence rule three does not split those two anymore. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. but then, i guess i jumped ahead by saying this was conditionally independent of that, because knowing this is independent, of that_ oh this is part of </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, that's          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          that's fine.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          hm. so really my splitting off this and showing all this was conditionally dependent didn't really mean anything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it did mean something it meant that you didn't have to go back and look at it again </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it didn't help me, for this though </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it did because, there's two ways to get over to all these nodes. there's this way which you've shown is conditionally independent, so you can break the network here, which simplifies it a lot, and you can effectively ignore this this link here.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so that lets you s- divide the network into halves that are only connected by this one arrow.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, okay </U2>
          that does help. so now you just have to look and see, um,          <OVERLAP1> what all over here is </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that's what, that's what </OVERLAP1>
          was confusing me the arrows are only important when you're dividing it and then once you've divided it, you don't really consider the arrows anymore it's just a link of,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          of blobs or whatever. which is considered, network so,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          this is considered part of abdominal pain's network.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so you can say that this, is part of that just like you were saying three and five were part of one.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          if you had double arrows going from_ like if the arrows were reversed for, three and five,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay mhm </U2>
          you could still say that two was independent of three and of five.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          okay. alright that's what was getting me... alright. okay, and explain whether it would make sense to model this as noisy-or_ that's assuming these two things again right? or is it          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> nope </U2>
          just in general?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no because it doesn't make sense if you already know abdominal pain then it doesn't matter, how you model it because you know what it is. so, actually you shouldn't assume you have evidence for part C. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. and in assuming eviden- no evidence for part C, i can again break this,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure, mhm </U2>
          network here so, i have in effect shown that these, four things are independent. cuz this doesn't depend on that, or that or that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> s- which is one of the prerequisites for noisy-or.          <EVENT DESC="GASP"></EVENT>          oh wait no i can't show...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean uh the point is you don't know what you have as evidence so it's possible that you might have rash as evidence...          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so you wanna be careful when you state your assumptions if y- if you say i assume, that i have no evidence        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right i wrote since we don't have rash as evidence,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          stress is independent of allergy.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but if you had, rash as evidence then,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          then that's not the case anymore. so if you had rash as evidence maybe noisy-or wouldn't make sense.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          so you want to be clear on that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm assuming no evidence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <OVERLAP1> in w- well, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> in which case it would be o- </OVERLAP1>
          if you have no evidence then you can break it here and you can show that all these are independent.          <OVERLAP1> by rule three. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right and, </OVERLAP1>
          also you want to discuss what if uh, those aren't the only causes of abdominal pain and your network is just inaccurate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. well          <OVERLAP1> that's the, that's the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so talk about that </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          other assumption i made, uh and other causes are independent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> other causes are independent? what do you mean? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that the other causes are independent of each other and that they're all listed. there are no          <OVERLAP1> other (uh) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you're </OVERLAP1>
          assuming_ but does that make sense here? or can you think of something else that causes abdominal pain. i mean don't divorce yourself from the problem, this is a specific problem.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you could always introduce a (link) node there          <OVERLAP1> that's, independent </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, </OVERLAP1>
          well so so jus- just mention that, you might want to mention that somewhere.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. the cure-all. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah exactly. but it never hurts to say too much in these things. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it just makes the graders work harder. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well um... so, there are a couple things that you're not mentioning which_ are you assuming that you have no evidence? because what          <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> oh </U2>
          happens if          <OVERLAP1> you have </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI">           <OVERLAP2> ah ah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay so i have to take that into account          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          whether i have e- evidence.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay fo- for this one still desperate um,          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          a- a- a- and i (i think got) the right, uh formula.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
