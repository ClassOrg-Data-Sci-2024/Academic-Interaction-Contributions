       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> who's on his committee? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, oh it isn't up there. um, so Matt of course and Jim Dimmitt, um Steve Baker and Dave Sutep, who's a professor in physics. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you have two outside professors? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. uh although calling Steve, an outsider is          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> that's true </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so so </OVERLAP1>
          he's, so it's it's good to know your committee just strategically, for your, defense, um, and, uh, Steve, is gonna be already very familiar with this material and is gonna be pretty familiar with it          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and uh, uh Dave Sutep is gonna be, uh, completely, comfortable here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so f- for those of you who don't know Dave is the director of the program in complex systems, so, that that's how you know it makes sense to have a physics professor, on this, committee. okay, so, um thank you for coming, and i i look forward to your comments however sca- however scathing they may be. um, my talk my, proposal is called a market protocol for decentralized task allocation and scheduling. i would like to start with a concrete example to really motivate the problem, i am addressing here. so, this is a, a stylized um air combat domain. and what we have here is some commander who wants us to perform an air attack. and there are various resources, an- and agents that can help the um commander accomplish this task. um, in this case the commander, simply wants to use a bomber squad and a fighter squad for th- for the air attack, and, um the bomber squad and the fighter squad in turn need, um each need t- to take off from an airfield. um, for this particular problem, there are b- excess resources there are plenty of airfields to satisfy the demand, so we can actually accomplish all the tasks and satisfy this commander without really much difficulty. now the tricky thing comes in if we actually bring in another commander. um this, the second commander, wants you um, perform a ground attack, which involves a bomber squad, a paratrooper squad and a fighter squad and it can be any of these, um squads but it i- he does need all three of those squads. now the problem is these squads in turn need airfields, i- each one needs an airfield, and, but we can't satisfy both of these commanders at the same time, because they need a total of five um squads, but there are only four four units of the airfield available. so, i- if we need to somehow decide what the more valuable task is what the best cost-benefit trade-off is and, alloc- and in this case reallocate the goods, to, um meet the highest value task. uh in this case if we assume the commander, the commander two has a          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> what's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          higher value we want to reallocate the um, resources in such a way to satisfy him.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what's the concept of value? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> value i'll i'll get to that le- let's let's just kind of leave that a little bit vague right now we'll we'll just say there there's some, value to, the um, commanders for accomplishing, you know, um tasks, and there may be some costs in providing some of the resources, and i'll i'll formally define what what those, costs and values look like later. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know i i think, uh of course the reallocation is interesting but i, wouldn't necessarily, um, trivialize the initial, allocation, in the first place, you might wanna just say, you know how we come up with this original solution, th- in this case, it's easy to find one, but, that's part of, the work is how to, find solutions in these, networks you know the style of your presentation i- it says okay you know where th- i'm really, where i'm really starting is this reallocation problem that's not </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay w- s- so, so yes, so the the fir- that first resource allocation was part of the, whole allocation problem that wasn't a particularly difficult one, um, it it becomes a really, more challenging problem when you have the limited resources </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. right so here's for example how (to make it) more difficult. but also in just mentioning the problem, um, you might want to suggest to them that, that the the details of this are really ar- it's just completely contrived, for, a DARPA site visitor          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and um, uh, and what you're really, after is a general model of uh... you know these kinds of networks.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... so, what we a- what i do then, so i wanna formalize this model, um um, a bit and i do that in a in a task dependence network what i call a task dependence network. that's a very, there's a general model for how, we can do these um, these task allocation problems when we have these sort of hierarchical dependencies and we have to form a supply chain. um, so let me explain the portions of the task dependence network. now these circles throughout the network represent the tasks or the resources. um, in in either case i i actually treat them i- in exactly the same fashion i assume that a task, is performed by one agent on behalf of another, and that the results can't be, replicated for, can't be directly replicated for other agents y- if you want to have if you wanna have this task performed for say, (you know) an- any this task performed for two agents you would hafta have two agents performing it. so in that sense, the tasks are really the same as any resource any discrete resource these are, all discrete so, i um, basically call them goods. so all these circles represent goods which can be either, you know, a task or a resource. um, on this end, i have          <OVERLAP1> these box </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          uh you might another way uh another way to rephrase that might be, that, tasks are, resources that are supplied by other, agents, and uh, ma- might need another word but, tasks are, resources that are supplied by other agents and then there's, some, base resources that are supplied in the environment.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you- that that isn't e- even necessarily quite, the correct characterization you_ the- some of these prod- s- well          <OVERLAP1> i'll ge- some some agents </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> there sometimes there really </OVERLAP1>
          is no definition of task as opposed to resources        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> th- th- that's the whole point </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (right) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's just that </OVERLAP1>
          sometimes we think of them as tasks and          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> sometimes </OVERLAP1>
          we think of them,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i- it's </U2>
          as resources but there's no, distinction        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it may be more natural in some problems or another to call it task or resource, when you're actually characterizing          <OVERLAP1> a specific problem </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and some things </OVERLAP1>
          they might actually really be production chains when (i they) should be things that really are, thought of as resources.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know uh, a supply chain you know producing automobiles or a job shop the intermediate um, goods may be, physical resources, that          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> are </OVERLAP1>
          produced. so, on this end, the boxes are, consumers. and a consumer simply wants to, um acquire some good, some some good, and get some value from doing so. um, on the other hand, on the other end of the supply chain we have suppliers. and these suppliers, are able to supply, a um, a good, um and perhaps at some cost. the interesting agents in the system are really these ones in the middle. all these boxes in the middle are what i call producers. and a producer, um, has some set of inputs and a single output so it it require- it must, um acquire all of its inputs in order to produce its output. it cannot, um do anything with a, with only a subset of its um inputs. so in this case we say that, the if, that the inputs are complementary, whe- when you have to r- acquire all of them to produce. um, for the pre- first example, um this is a solution allocation for the problem and what a solution is, is, okay fir- first let me, back up and say what an allocation is an allocation is just a subset of the of the task dependence network, that indicates which agents bought and sold which goods. um, (and) in this case um, the um the green circles are the goods that are bought or sol- that are bought and sold, and the green agents are the agents that bought or sold something and the and the dark arro- actually i didn't explain what these arcs are, um in the previous thing, the, um the arcs, let me go back, in in_ the arcs indicate input-output relationships, so if an arc from an agent to a good indicates that the agent can, um pr- s- supply that good in some sense, and an arc from a good to an agent indicates that the agent ca- wants to acquire um one unit of that good, as input, or for consumption. so going back to the s- to an allocation, a dark arrow indicates that the agent, um either bought or sold the good and the grey arrows are um, are failed attempts to acquire or sell goods.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you said this was the first example? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. this_ s- so          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> th- this </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          basically i don't          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> this </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          have this commander two here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. but you have, the ground attack, there. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, we could say that this, this agent exists here but is is not accomplishing anything. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it might be more clear to people, if you don't have that ground attack (thing there) if you claim this as the first example </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but actually in a way it might be clearer if you do, because,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> well but thi- but it looks like </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it shows that that's the way </OVERLAP1>
          you can ha- that you can accommodate having these, things that are just not useful,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and it doesn't wreck anything.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's right          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          these are all the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> capabilities </OVERLAP1>
          in the system,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> just </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> tha- </OVERLAP1>
          those don't change what's c- what you're capable of doesn't change the only thing that changes is what's, what's wanted.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you might wanna, so, if you wanna make that point then, and keep it this way then you have to point out, see the, just the graph, makes it look a lot more like the second example than the first example. so you have to point out that, the thing on the bottom isn't, commander it's just the, capability. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, mkay... um, so, (sorta) explain what the allocation is now a solution allocation is one where, one or more of the consumers actually acquire their goods and there's basically a complete supply chain all the way back to the suppliers. what that means is, well there's two things to, have a complete supply chain one is that for any good, the number of input arcs equals the number of arc- output arcs, or in other words supply equals demand. um, another requirement is any producer, that is selling its output good must also acquire all of its input goods, so, that is we r- require that the producers be feasible. and again here's another example of a,          <OVERLAP1> of a s- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you gonna </OVERLAP1>
          explain the light green?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i'll d- i'll do that right now. um, well maybe i'll d- i'll do it in a minute. so also i do have, i wanna point out there's this, producer here that is, colored light green, um, what i've i've done that to distinguish it from the other producers, um, this producer did acquire its input, but didn't sell its output. now that is allowed in a solution, it's not, uh es- the most, i- it's a little bit kind of wasteful to use some resources that um really don't, you know that are, that the producer doesn't want because it's not producing an output. but, we we need to consider this possibility, in in these, um solutions. and again i, showed, here here's the example again with the second commander coming in and shows how the um, how the, how the links change to feed the supply chain into the second commander. um, i wanna talk a little, go, back a little bit to the costs and values i that i hinted at. um i assume that, each consumer, is interested in potentially a, you know some set of goods, but, the consumer only wants to acquire one unit of one of the goods. um, so basically, (you know) it can acquire, some value for any, particular good but its total value is just the maximum of all those values of the goods that it obtains. the suppliers, um have some opportunity costs for supplying the goods, this can either be some real costs for, you know t- real monetary costs for um, supplying the good or maybe some lost value from some other use it could have put the, um, good to. so in this case i just say each supplier, its its total um, opportunity cost is the sum of of the individual opportunity costs for each good. um, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so um... uh you said you have a a, the quantifier of G and X in the second bullet you probably should have it in the first bullet too. so the max over G, should be G and X </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yes, you're right. you're right. yep.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          now, although this this may seem like a somewhat limiting um, um, set of, utility functions it turns out that, actually w- um with the consumer value, you can model quite a a large number of problems by playing some tricks with the suppliers.          <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          see you've changed it cuz it used to be, i mean, it's easy to picture what a_ c- consumers, are just like everybody else except they have no output, i mean that's, the semantics of the symbols and stuff and, suppliers are, just like everybody else but they have no input.          <U2 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>

          (that'll help) but, also do you want to say anything about, you know like pointing out that uh, uh, the ground attack makes a profit, and that commander two is happy, and you know i mean without,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> s- </U2>

          i was goi- i mean i could talk about that,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (i don't, b- but) </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> so i was gonna </OVERLAP1>
          talk about it formally here, maybe i maybe it's good        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it might've helped to have given an example just look at this eyeballing the network first and then... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's a good idea </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that paratrooper one supposed to be green? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> paratrooper one, paratrooper one, that is a bug, i'll get rid of that... no no, that isn't a bug the um, it_ what is the fron- yes, tha- that's a bug, that's not green. thank you. so, what's going on here? well, the s- so how these agents use these prices t- to guide their decision-making? well these these, consumers, want to um, acquire their in- acquire a good, at a price below their value. so you can see that this commander's, um ha- i- is a is acquiring its its input good for twenty-two dollars which is less than its value of thirty. and the suppliers on the other end, are willing to sell their good if they can um, recoup their costs, a- at least recoup their costs. now the producers in the middle don't have any intrinsic value for the goods so what they're looking for is just strictly profit, they they're willing t- they they'd be willing to be active in the solution if the um sum of their i- if their output co- um value, their output price is greater than or equal to the sum of their input prices. and this is just um, a formal statement of that um the agents are_ ideally the agents would want to maximize their surplus, where the surplus is defined as i specified, it's basically the difference between the value they get and the costs incurred.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so the in, the journal-equilibrium approach, um the kind of the ideal situation is to end up with a competitive equilibrium, through some m- you know somehow to get a c- competitive equilibrium what this means is, simply that, um there's a set of prices, such that the_ an- and an allocation such that, the agents get an optimal surplus allocation, at the equilibrium prices. um what this means is, the consumer, will get the single good that maximizes its surplus, the different_ so the the the maximizes the difference between the value of the good it gets and the price of that good. if it gets any other goods, in this model, those the prices better be zero because they're not any_ adding any extra value. um, a supplier will simply sell each good, that_ for which it can, um get, acquire uh work_ that it can sell for a price higher than, the value for that good. and the producers, will buy all their inputs and sell their output if they're profitable, um otherwise they, wanna trade nothing. and so, tha- that's so this includes both the um, the, optimal, the optimality constraint and also the fe- the feasibility constraint i talked about before. and also would require that, supply and demand be balanced.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i- uh someo- some producers are at a, negative value,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> do you need </OVERLAP1>
          to explain the, uh competitiveness assumption? are you making a competitiveness assumption?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's kinda, well it's implicit in this, i- i'm i'm not talking about any_ i'm not talking about_ competitiveness is be- whe- is when you're talking about behavior, i'm not talking about behavior, the only assumption is here is that they're optimizing with respect to prices only. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the current prices          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          wi-with respect to some set of prices. i'm not i'm i'm uh sidestepping the issue, of how you would get a competitive equilibrium right now        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but di- but what makes it a competitive equilibrium is that everything is relative to given prices, and that's, stated,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          you know          <OVERLAP1> there. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
          so what are the_ so, here's an example of a competitive equilibrium. um, um, in this case, um you notice that for all the green agents, they're making a positive surplus, or a nonnegative surplus at least so for instance this agent, um its its output is six-dollars-and-fifty-cents, and its inputs are six dollars, so it's making a sixty-s-cent profit, a fifty-cent profit, and it's willing to, be active.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so tho- those are A B to E </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i- it's stable with respect to prices meaning the agent no agent would want to um, do anything differently, at the current prices. </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so so first </OVERLAP1>
          of all what's different from this and the previous example?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, the the only difference here is, that the consumer has a lower value. um, yes i'll maybe explain that so, this is showing, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what was it before? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, i think it was fifteen. um, now the the key to h- here is that, the total cost for the solution is um, is seven, and the consumer has a value of nine. so it_ i me- if we were to have an equilibrium, it should be this solution because that's efficient. however i'm going to show that we can't have an equilibrium if the consumer has a pr- value this low. and the reason it_ so if we have, we look at this, um, um, constraint, this is to ensure that, that this agent is profitable. on the other hand this, constraint, is to ensure that this agent, is not profitable, because if we raise this sufficiently high, um then this agent, can't make a profit on there. well what that means, that if you take these two constraints and (keep) them together we have, that price the price of F has to be greater than or equal to eleven. so even though, um we_ the, um, thi- this solution, would be e- this particular solution would be efficient for the consumer having a value range from seven_ from anywhere above seven, we actually can't have an equilibrium if its value is below eleven. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the the consumer shouldn't be green, i don't think. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i'm just showing, i'm saying, this is what the allocation would be, </U1>

          had a value as low as seven, we would still have_ it would still be efficient to_ this solution would still be efficient. however, we_ for for c- for a certain range of consumer values, we can't get an equilibrium.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and the way you, explained it was, you know that price has to be high enough su- such that the supply_ um, the producer was not active          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> correct </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> w- w- well first </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep. we're using a particular variant with a an M-plus-first-price auction rule. so there's an auction for each good. um, to kee- one important point is these auct- this auction is two sided. both the buyers and the sellers will bid in the auction. and, as an iterative asynchronous auction, that runs um, you know according to this bi- you know high level structure. um, first, some agents bid, and whenever an auction receives a bid, it issues a price quote. and, then, um then maybe some agents when they receive that price quote will decide to change their bid, in which case the auction will submit a new price quote and re- repeats this continuously, until, the agents stop bidding. at which point we've reached quiescence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, that's kind of weird but what is it what is the bid this is supposed to be the program for the auction? </U1>

          how about, just, instead of repeating anything, how about you have a loop that says something like until quiescence, on bid, issue price quote.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          uh, and then, clear.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> (well but wait) the point is it's event driven. the auction          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> from the uh </OVERLAP1>
          the auction is completely event driven. it receives bid when it receives bid it's uh does something          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right right right </U2>
          and then, when quiescence, is reached it exits that, event driven mode and just does something.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. i'll agree to that. so tha- that continues until the agents stop bidding, at which point the auction's e- the auctions will clear. and the clearings determines the final prices for the goods, and, actually i should explain what the price quotes are i think i, glossed          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> over </OVERLAP1>
          that and, um, so, lemme go back so, lemme lemme, rephrase this so, un- until_ so the auct- th- the, whene- whenever an auction receives a bid, it will issue a new price quote. and a price quote, basically provides some intermediate information which um, specifies the um, w- what the prices would be now based on the current state of bids. now of course, this is subject to change because once the agents receive these price quotes, they may want to submit new bids. so, um every time so every time the agents do submit a new bid the auction then submits a new you know releases a new price quote. and this continues until all the agents stop bidding, at which point we're at quiescence, w- what i call quiescence. when this is finished the um, auctions will clear. and a clearing, ba- it determines the final prices, it determines an allocation, which specifies which agents get what. now throughout this bidding process, the auctions um, require that both the buy bids and the sell bids must i- increase. now this is a little bit different from standard auction au- much of the auction literature, um where only the buy bids must increase, but we do find that, um requiring both buy and sell bids to increase, um is is important for pr- um proving some of the conversions properties we, achieve.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's different mainly because most, most ascending mechanisms ther- are only one sided. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's true.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>
          well there are there are some, some, there are some, two sided options where the, sells must go down and the buys must go up, but. um, anoth- i don't wanna go into too much detail about what's involved -volved in the clearing but the important point is that, the auctions balance the reported supply and demand, at unif- at a uniform price so each auction ha- specifies a single price at which all the agents trade at, at that auction. now this is a, very complicated problem to analyze um, you know the ideal s- um, sit- you kn- tr- tr- traditional s- approach would be to, um, calculate a Bayes-Nash equilibrium on behalf of the_ for each of the agents and assume that the agents behave rationally a- according to a Bayes-Nash equilibrium. unfortunately doing so is k- is kind of beyond the state of the art, and, and for something this complex, so we are simply assume that the um, the agents use some very simple bidding policies, that do obey the ascending restriction and also can obey the decentral- tr- decentralization constraint in that the agents only, consider the goods of direct interest to them. so the suppliers, um simply bid their fixed i should change that to cost they they simply bid what their costs are, for their goods. and um, and a consumer, will, um, start by bidding zero, for all the its goods of interest and whenever it's losing, whenever it's not winning a bid, it will raise, its bid on on one of its goods of interest that wi- would maximize its surplus at the current prices and it increments it by a small amount. um, the, producer, is is the the interesting agent here as i mentioned, for its output          <OVERLAP1> i- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i'm </OVERLAP1>
          sorry it, it increments beyond the current quote        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> y- yes, a small amount beyond the current price quote.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          the producer will bid for its output the sum of its, current of of the current prices of its inputs. and it will also add in a small increment for each input that it's currently losing. and that's under the assumption that, if it's losing an input, it could actually win it if it bid a little bit higher than the current price. um for the inputs, a producer will start by bidding zero, and then will increment its a bid on an input whenever it's infeasible, that is when it's, winning its output but losing that particular input. now sh- i'll give you a concrete example of the producer here. now this is a producer um, the prices are specified here in the current bids, the green arrows indicate bids that it's currently winning, and this red arrow indicates the bid that it's currently losing. so, the producer has no reason to raise its, input bid on A, because it's winning it. however since so it holds that pr- bid at two. however, the producer is, winning its output but losing this input. so it would raise its bid on B, to two. um, for its output it will bid the sum of its input prices, two plus one, and it will also add an increment on, f- for this, bid for this bid, because it's losing it, so it will bid a total of four. here i- i'm i'm assuming that it it has an we have an increment of one dollar.        </U1>

          um, so, so since you have a big quote you can say that, you could say that the consumer_ the producer will, offer to sell it, at that quote, or,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know but the th- </U2>

          costs are greater than that they just choose the minimal amount over that quote, hoping to be_ to (lay the win,) as the prices rise.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but but i what i'm assuming is here you_ when you bid for your output, it you're you're assuming that, you want to at least cover the cost of your inputs. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so, but if the, if it so happened that, the bid price was much more than that, than the cost of your inputs, then, a reasonable strategy would just be to bid that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> n- well, no you could say a reasonable strategy is to stop bidding on your inputs, maybe          <OVERLAP1> but you don't you won't </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, but so, so that seems like a reasonable story,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          but i, and i think it's also true that it turns out that, these bidding policies, make it so that, you're almost always, in the c- situation where you're placing your bid where, you're above, you have to_ because your inputs have increased, your new bid has to be greater than what someone's willing to buy so you, just do          <OVERLAP1> (as minimally) above </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it may or may not be higher than that. alright, you're winning all you kn- you know that you're winning this at some price, if you bid above that current pr- the current, bid price, that's because your costs, your current costs are, are too high. if you bid bel- if you bid below it then your costs are less than that and you're still gonna stay in the game. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so look at it this way, suppose that, uh, Dave and i are sellers and you're a buyer. we know that there you you've offered to buy at ten. and it costs me, three.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so i say, i know, i'm gonna offer to sell at nine, let's try to get more than (almost in) surplus. well Dave comes in and offers to sell at eight, and i can't lower the price because it's an ascending, auction.          <U2 WHO="SU-2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (okay) </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> i'm, </OVERLAP1>
          i'm screwed... so, that's one reason why, i shouldn't have gone right to nine i should have stayed at, three, and raise it to nine later maybe.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but if you were the only,          <OVERLAP1> supplier </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and i and i well y- okay now i guess i'm understanding is you're saying, the bid all the way up well also you have to keep in mind that, that might work, okay if you're the only s- s- seller, selling to a consumer. but if you're somewhere in the middle of the chain, you bid up too high, on on multiple ends, then </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, yeah so, i'm, i think that, there's, there's some way to help explai- to help raise the intuition about why you might not wanna, raise your bid. why you wanna_ as a seller, and a producer who's selling you might want to stick to this simple policy.          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so i i think </OVERLAP1>
          i think it is hard to justify in the end, i think          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you'd </OVERLAP1>
          wanna just_ i mean the main justification is it's, it's myopic and simple.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it's not really myo- i mean it's not optimally myopic it seems. is it?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, </U2>
          i mean if the world were to end t- today, or tomorrow, would that be the optimal way, strategy?        </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> running way late on the (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          but but i think the point, i- it's a good point is that there the (the sheet of) issues though are really complicated and no you're not gonna be able to successfully, argue for it, you could, you know try some things but i don't know if it's probably not worth it, you might,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but some simple intuitions might </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well but, but the first impression of the bidding strategy is just that it's so, natural. for sellers to raise their bids cuz that decreases their chances. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but what we know is there's actually lots of strategies, that, s- all seem plausible, and uh and some of them, don't work. most of them don't work and the one that Rob identified works and that's really,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          interesting it's not because it's more, uh strategically appropriate than the others, at all.        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> explored it in depth </OVERLAP1>
          for the system. uh, now i'm i've talked about equilibrium before, um, i wanna_ you know i talked about a peer-competitive equilibrium there_ i've also defined something called a lambda-delta competitive equilibrium which is an an approximate equilibria, whe- where, the error from equilibria is, is, corresponds to the increment parameters in the bidding policies. and it turns out that this_ um the reason why i do thi- specify this is beca- when we have these discrete jumps, we can some- you know, you know it's it's pretty, impossible to exactly hit an equilibria, you may miss it by a little bit, um, but just intr- introducing these pr- you know these parameters and the concept, um, means we can talk about some_ you know equilibria we sometimes get close to. um, and this, this approximate equilibria is inefficient in proportion to the bid parameters. so i- it's it's it's suboptimal by by some bounded amount, which w- you know in proportion to these parameters. um, and it turns out that this          <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          are the bid parameters?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh i don't,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> just the increment? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the the increm- </OVERLAP1>
          basically the increment, the increment and the loss, a- and the input, the increment on your output and your input for the producers. and also consumers. um, and it turns out that this this bidding policy and the auction mechanism, if that, results in no, dead ends on the producer and a dead end is a is a producer that, buys some inputs but not its output. so if we have no no no producers like that, then we have this, lambda-delta competitive equilibrium, and it is an if-and-only-if, statement. now, even when we generalize this, n- notion of equilibria we're not guaranteed to reach, that equilibria, even when one exists, um, for two general reasons um, one is we may overshoot the equilibrium prices um, some of these you know this_ the price of this good goes higher than the minimum equilibrium price, um this agent is bidding hi- actually higher than eleven, here, because, of of the, that increment on its inputs. so we can overshoot it, and also as i mentioned we have we can have dead ends where this is what happens when you actually run the system, where y- you'd have a producer like this, that that buys an input but doesn't sell its output, so that's how we can miss the equilibrium. so since, since the equilibria, um, some i- is, since we we can't always get an equilibria i defined a somewhat weaker notion on prices called the valid solution, where basically all the agents in the solution have a nonnegative surplus, except for some producers may, may, i do allow that some producers may buy some inputs but not sell their output.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> word, you have the word surplus twice (and not just once) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep, thanks. so when we define this, we can talk about, some properties of this of this, bidding policy and, auction mechanism. um, because of the ascending auction rule, the bidding does always stop we always reach quiescence. um, if we reach a valid solution and the price of the goods for any losing consumer is higher than their, value, then we've, then we'll reach quiescence with a valid solution. on the other hand if we reach quiescence in at least some consumer_ at least one consumer's winning, we have a valid solution. um empirically i've also, um, based on uh, many thousands of experiments i i, i find that, if at least some consumer in the system values its, uh good high enough, that's relative to the other values in the          <OVERLAP1> system </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so let's </OVERLAP1>
          say, thousands of experiments it's really thousands of randomly generated examples          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> thousands of            <OVERLAP2> random- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (thousands) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, thousands of y- you know,          <OVERLAP1> about three-thousand </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          randomly generated instances i find, find that i- if the consumer values a good highly enough, then the then a valid solution will form for that consumer... um, now i'm i talked about this problem of these dead-end producers that buy their inputs but not their outputs. we can improve the efficiency of the system, by allowing decommitment on those producers. and what that, um, basically means is any producer, that, that buys some inputs but not its output can decommit from those input contracts and then we recursively go back to the suppliers and basically cut off that portion of the supply chain. and as an example, what we do in this, what we do here is, we basically let this producer and this supplier, decommit from their contracts. and that would increase the efficiency, um, actually increase the value of solution by one-dollar in this case. and and in this case we would have the optimal, solution. with the decommitment.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and an equilibrium. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um no, it would not_ well if you_ not an equilibrium because you still have          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh the supplier, right right right right right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this_ because of the prices um, </OVERLAP1>
          if you if you actually threw them out of complete consideration all the o- rest of the agents are in a an approximate equilibrium... um, i've done, um, i've done some more empirical analysis based on, um, over three thousand randomly generated trials, with a range of goods and, and and agents, uh i measured the fraction of optimal surplus and i compare- i compared the economy run with an A-star so- um search, and, the this protocol with with the bidding policies in in the auctions i specified, give a mean of, efficiency of eighty-three percent. but when we, include the decommitment, the efficiency rises to ninety-seven percent. uh, i found that          <OVERLAP1> ninety- about uh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah you really need </OVERLAP1>
          to qualify those, numbers, to point out          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i was i was </OVERLAP1>
          gonna do that at the end, or or i i        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think right when you mention those numbers you've got to the o- the the next ones are l- are much less arbitrary so, i think it's worth pointing making a point with respect to these          <OVERLAP1> numbers. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mkay </OVERLAP1>
          so one thing you do have to_ we have to be a little bit wary of, is remember that, um, you know i ha- i have this conjecture that if you if, some consumer, i- ha- s- values its goods sufficiently highly will reach a solution well we could, we could set some consumer's value to an arbitrarily high number, and know that we're gonna reach a n- uh a a solution, and there we could get arbitrarily high values, i- because i- you know, we ar- get arbitrarily close to optimum efficiency if if the if that consumer's value dominates all other values in the system. um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay could you explain that          <OVERLAP1> so if the if the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (and you did it?) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          consumer's value is a b- is a billion, then it doesn't really matter then the, the um surplus it's a billion minus, uh ten versus a billion minus nine          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          know that's there's not go- you're not gonna be able to, measure much difference in that fraction, whereas, nine versus ten, is a, you know could be significant actually, it's not nine, but a billion minus ten versus a billion minus one, uh they're pretty much the same whereas          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          the cost ratio is still much more.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah so so we have to_ yeah i tried to design this experiment so that that isn't, a s- a strong artifact but, we you know we have to keep that in mind. um, i i did find that thirty-seven percent of the trials converged to the approximate equilibrium i talked about. and of those that did not converge to an equilibrium, the remaining seventy-three perce- the the remaining ones had seventy-three percent efficiency, and when we include the decommitment we had a ninety-five percent efficiency. so what this suggests, is that this protocol, is, you know it sometimes reaches equilibrium, but it st- it produces good results on average even when it doesn't e- reach equilibrium. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so do you have any sense of, uh what fraction can actually have an approximate equilibrium? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i do not have that i i haven't tried to measure that that that would          <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>

          in in in in, in the ninety-percent and above region, very heavily weighted, um, basically, over ninety-percent are, of of the trials had ninety-percent or greater efficiency. the um part of the reason why, why these numbers are as low as they are is because there there's a good chunk of of of, results o- of runs that had negative, value. because so mo- there are more, there, so basically the cost overwhelmed the value to the consumers. and tha- and tha- and that's why, the decommitment was so useful, because it got rid of a lot of wasted, resource- you know, decommitted from a lot of wasted resources.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, i've talked about, um you know w- you know the results of this, protocol. one there's one thing i've sidestepped is, how d- how do we know when when this, when we've reached quiescence? that's a straightforward thing to do if we're simulating this on a centralized system, where we know what the state of all the agents in the auctions. it's a, much more difficult problem when we have decentralized auctions and agents running on you know separate processes in a on an asynchronous system. um, the tr- the problem is that, local quiescence at one auction, does not imply global quiescence. so agents may have stopped bidding at one auction but there may be still activity going on in, other parts in the economy and if there's still activity elsewhere, prices could propagate back to that auction and there would be later activity. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, so actually, it's not even clear what local quiescence means. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm, so i gue- so local quiescence meaning, if a if a a particular auction hasn't received bids for, you know, you know, five seconds or whatever time period </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it doesn't mean that, (when they say quiescence) it means, i mean actually literally it means that no one, wants to bid, at the current price,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          at the current state no one even wants to.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but they may but the point you made is that they may want to later,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          based on a change in another.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> correct </U2>
          see what_ maybe something like, um, you know, current_ quiescence at a certain time, which you'll define you know later does not mean that it's gonna stay quiescent, that there's other auctions that are still active.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you could say inactivity at one auction          <OVERLAP1> instead of quiescence </OVERLAP1>

          we have consumers, not me- wanting to change their bids they s- pass messa- uh a message called, that s- says, i'm quiescent. and uh, and, and if if the rest of the network is really quiescent also, it will, propagate back to the suppliers. um, but if at any point, new bids come about, um, the that message will not be propagated back and the auctions will wake up and continue their bidding. oh i mean the auctions will continue the price quotes and the agents will continue their bidding. um, one step those messages reach the suppliers if the if the suppliers are really, you know, are ar- agree that they are quiescent they don't have anything they want to change, they will say o- they'll send a f- a message firm, which sa- basically says i am firm, you know i'm certain that that i'm quiescent (key) locally, and agents and auctions will propagate that message back, to the consumers if they agree with that message, if if there haven't been any price changes or new bids. and once this, once this information propagates to the metaconsumer, the metaconsumer will send a signal saying, a clear signal, basically which will propagate to the network, and all the auctions will close down and clear.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> how do you know? basically y- y- an auction, will pass a message only if on- if it receives a firm from all of its, bidders. that's why you have to know who your bidders are. and the same with the quiescent, basically the messages, an auction passes on a message only if it receives it. it passes a quiescence only if it receives it from all its buyers, it'll pass on a firm only if it receives it from all its sellers. and turns out, uh given these assumptions with this protocol, um, auctions will clear if and only if, we have global quiescence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> there's a certain incentive for the, agents who are, you know buying something but they're not able to sell it that may not want to send off a firm, message, you know </U1>

          and that's something, that i need to look at, in in combination with the incentives for the bidding policy. um, we can prob- uh what i'd like to do is, perhaps we can combine this quiescence detection protocol with with the decommitment protocol and if we can somehow combine the signals so agents can signal you know okay i'm detecting quiescence but you gotta let me, decommit because i'm not ready here. um, briefly touch on some oth- some related work, um, a lot of work has been done in, a for task allocation and task oriented domains, here there aren't these um, they don't they don't have these test dependence networks they they have kind of they have          <OVERLAP1> tasks </OVERLAP1>

          Rosenschein's Law can have defined and others such as Sandholm have also pursued work in that general area, domain, and the idea is that, to reallocate tasks among agents um, basically any reallocation of tasks is feasible but bec- but the- there are different costs depending on what combination of tasks that agents have. um, Anderson and Sandholm have looked at contract decommitment, and in in a task oriented type domain and they found, also that decommitment can greatly improve the efficiency, um Davis and Smith um, in- invented a protocol called Contract Net which actually does look at these hierarchical dependencies in the supply chain formation, um, it doesn't um, i- basically ta- does- it takes a different approach it does a top-down allocation starting from the consumer, um which means that if there are, um resource limitations in the system, it there would have to be some sort of backtracking to account for that and, um, u- usually you don't really u- to my knowledge that_ they're really they're they aren't rea- usually approach the problem of, of, of, strict resource limitations. they may look at different costs, depending on availability. and also, Sandholm and Baker have looked at some variants on that. um there's a wide variety of auction literature i've talked about the simultaneous ascending auctions, that there's there's a rich literature in that, to mention there um,          <OVERLAP1> var- </OVERLAP1>

          but what, what i might suggest is just getting rid of the sub-bullets under the second and mayb- maybe add another... set of quo- set of, you know of things at that level, so, the main thing is you've got this decentralized          <OVERLAP1> solution method </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and also the number, and, taking some, um, problem statement and converting it to your model, could be that the number of nodes explodes exponentially. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's a little, um,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i realize that it may not in other formulations </U2>
          if if we had agents that were potentially interested in any combination of goods yes, um we would have an exponential explosion.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually yeah right, what is, the looking at the centralized solution what is complexity of this, problem. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the- yeah this is, i i haven't proven this but i strongly believe it's this the problem is M-P complete to do centrally, because it very, closely resembles, a an- minimum and-or, it could be in a minimum and-or graph, certainly          <OVERLAP1> took </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and is </OVERLAP1>
          that is that known to be M-P complete?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes, computing a minimum weight and-or, graph is M-P complete. this is a little bit          <OVERLAP1> different </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
          restricted so you could (check) that might be worth knowing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um yeah i haven't put the effort into, doing the, the translation um, certainly when i try and compute efficiency using, you know the A-star takes a long time </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but if,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah so </U2>
          i mean but yours could be doubly...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i doubt that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it shouldn't be better, but          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          it's not obvious it should be, you know worse by any particular, you know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it looks a lot like a, minimum weight and-or graph problem... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i to re- to return to the the analogy with or the connection with the minimum weight an- and-or problem i mean that's, a computationally burdensome problem, which uh, one might want to parallelize if you have multiple processors you might wanna, exploit them and what you're presenting is a method for, parallelizing as well as decentralizing, the solution of a related problem is that interesting from a, i can imagine people          <OVERLAP1> in parallel computing (thinking that was really) interesting </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i w- i would, i i would, </OVERLAP1>
          be hesitant to argue that this is the b- that if you have all the information centrally i wouldn't be hesitant to argue that this is the best way to go about it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> even the best way to parallelize it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you have it all centrally and then you break it up, and parallelize it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah generally, when you parallelize an algorithm the best, not the best thing to do is like, have one processor in each node and only look at your, closest neighbor that's not the best (way) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. um, since we've gone over um, quite a lot uh, probably should end it but thanks for all for your, patience and i think we've raised a bunch of things that, will come up again in time and of course, the committee's gonna raise just all sorts of, other, (considerably) comfortable things that, you can anticipate. but, i think you've got a lot to, sh- to defend yourself, i don't uh anticipate any difficulties </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i know we started late i f- can't remember when we started am i o- roughly okay on time here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> y- yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i think you'll need to monitor that, dynamically. because there's gonna be a l- you know res- shock events you know          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> digressions </OVERLAP1>
          and, you may need to f- think ahead of time about where you might, recover time if, if you fall behind.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can skip stuff that you couldn't skip with us because they'll have read the paper, so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, that's that's a risky assumption </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i mean, if you wanna if you need to make up time you might be able to          <OVERLAP1> say </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so so </OVERLAP1>
          alright they they are supposed to have read the paper,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so you can          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
         <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you could you could say uh since you read it        </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> since you read it          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i'll, i'll breathe thr- breeze through this section and, right        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no they'll say oh, wait </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> they, they usually will. um, yeah. okay? uh do uh, do we have any, topic for next week? i don't remember if we, set one... anybody want to set one? </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it might be worth </OVERLAP1>
          mentioning one of those points though one of those, you guys got several, things in your portfolio that, haven't          <OVERLAP1> been, talked about </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> haven't talked about, </OVERLAP2>
            okay, i'll do that.          </U2>
          but yeah, let's figure out what it is, (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you want us to m- can you meet, sometime today? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um... yeah. why don't we say... four-o'clock? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i might be here earlier (though) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. but you have to, take off right now? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so so you said you'll be around? will you have any, time? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i got a proposal to get out this afternoon          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and i'm not sure, how long          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> well i'll catch you on Monday </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that might (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          alright. uh if i'm around this afternoon and i have slack i'll i'll try to (catch you)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'll try to go fast </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. um, okay. so we've got that set for next week. great. i think we're done. </U1>
