          um, a couple weeks ago_ unfortunately i have a direct conflict usually during your meetings but i wanted to come in, and say, a couple weeks ago i had the opportunity to go to the, um, concentration advisings fair, that you guys hosted, and it was heaven to me. because i'm a pre-life student, um, not too sure what i'm gonna do yet, and there's about four or five things i wanted to check out but it's been tough to set up appointments, with four different people to discuss things, and it was really easy to walk around and just say hey what's up? how're you doing? what about this? what about that? it was really cool. um, and there was a lot of positive feedback from my friends i got some guys in my hall to go, um, it was neat and uh i told some of the officers, and stuff and some people that i see around but i wanted to tell everybody, because i know all of you put some time into it, i thought it was really cool. in fact i'd recommend it twice a year like once each semester, um, the reason being is cuz, as you take courses as a university student, your interests vary and they develop, and you might wanna just check it out one more time. um i think you guys had pretty good attendance and like i didn't hear one negative thing and the best part was like, all the people that were there, giving advice from the different departments, were just awesome people. like they were into it they were excited and they were happy to be doing it so, just wanted to say, like keep it up and like hopefully we'll see one next semester too, so        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> hi, um, i'm John Epstein i'm the uh chair of communications for M-S-A, um, turn really quick to the back, of the, agenda that you just got, um, i'm really proud of this this is a, historic, moment. this is, um, as far as our records, indicate, this is the first, resolution presented to the L-S-and-A student government, on behalf of the Michigan Student Assembly committee. um, so that's, i'm i'm proud of that i think that's pretty cool. um, the resolution is, uh as you can probably tell by its title, uh to sponsor a petition to improve the C-C-R-B. M-S-A took this on, um, couple weeks ago and, uh Matt spoke to you about it last week and told you that we were gonna be doing this and told you that, we were_ that that um, that we were taking the C-C-R-B on that we wanted to improve it, this is the actual formal support. um, we'd like you guys to do this tonight. reason being, we have a meeting on Thursday with the director of the C-C-R-B. if we can take this resolution to him, and say look, students support it we have, five hundred signatures on petitions we have a resolution unanimously passed by M-S-A, we have a resolution passed by the L-S-and-A student government, um, and then just go down the list and and show him, and show the administration that students think this is a big deal, they will listen to us they will, do the improvements and things'll get done. um, now i understand that you guys have a first and second reads process, so do we. and i don't wanna violate that process, i think it's i think first and second reads are important, um, if you can pass this tonight, cool, great. it's more important that it gets passed overall. um, this meeting on Thursday is not going to be the last meeting, regarding improvements of the C-C-R-B next week, we're gonna start meeting with the provost we're gonna start meeting with the, vice-president for uh student affairs, and those meetings are to be honest more important than the meeting on Thursday. if you pass this next week, it will still be extremely useful to the improvement effort, if you pass it this week, it'll be even more useful, but, i don't want you guys to um, uh, split any hairs about it i don't want, um, i don't want it to be a major debate, it's more important that this gets passed in general than that it gets passed tonight. but if it does get passed tonight, great. um, Matt Hackworth is the sponsor and, uh, for L-S-and-A S-G and i assume he'll be talking about it a little bit, um, when you guys get to it. we have to leave now to make the M-S-A meeting but, are there any questions? or or comments about, the resolution or about, uh anything that M-S-A's doing right now? alright          <OVERLAP1> great </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> uh, the first reason that they didn't get, a large majority of the money they asked for is because, they're all law students, and uh, that might seem like absurd at first of a r- sponsoring a, law students kind of journal and, to put on speaker, events but, the fact is a lot of L-S-and-A pre-law students attend them. and they seemed like pretty well-funded and a lot of the money they wanted, was, for, travel, but we weren't gonna fund them for, having their, speakers fly in round-trip, at uh, six hundred dollars a ticket so we, funded them for, printing posters only. and that, three hundred dollars would cover that. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i had a question about Encompass, i understand that that's a, it's a multicultural show being put on, um, during, the time of, Diversity Theme Semester, and i was wondering um, i mean i know of of different kinds of funding that Encompass has just because it is Diversity Theme Semester i was wondering, why they were given eight hundred out of a thousand as opposed to, the IASA show a couple weeks ago that was only given two hundred? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> uh, that's a good question and we like thought about that, for a while and what it comes down to is that, just like, us sponsoring Dance Marathon last year, it was a, it was a, like a take-off of that, it was like the first year you know          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and it's the first year they're putting on Encompass, and it's supposed to be a big deal and, us sponsoring it, with this amount of money would help really, help it really get off its feet, so that next year, they could, um, find sponsors of their own and so forth. like it's, our investment now is gonna help them_ help it grow so that they won't need as much money from us in the future.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so if you look on the back of, the very end of, the uh, agenda, titled, special allocations proposal, i, reworded it based on the suggestions i was given, um, and i went with the approach that, has people that ask for more than a thousand dollars, has them go through the budget allocations, committee, and then they come up with a recommendation, for the next meeting, or whenever they get around to it, hopefully at the next meeting, for us to d- start with, and then talk about the decision so, let's say Dance Marathon came, they would come, and they would be directed to the budget allocations committee. the Budget Allocations Committee would have them fill out a, budget allocation form, you know, what, expenses they have and that, information. they would hold an interview if they need to, but they don't have to, and then at the next week's meeting, the Budget Allocations Committee would come and say, we recommend that we give them, fifteen hundred dollars for Dance Marathon. and they would be here to talk if th- if Dance Marathon needed to talk to, to add to to our discussion and answer questions. it's, it's basically what we've done before except it has them go, through the budget allocations committee and give us, give us more information t- to decide on. um, hopefully that'll, that'll st- streamline the, the, discussion of what we should give 'em, so it, it feels less ar- arbitrary, and we, can go into it better, informed and also we, involve Budget Allocations Committee in this way. um, it's not in resolution form, because this isn't a resolution. um, this is, i i put this up so that we can, vote, to f- to support this process, this internal process, so that when a group comes we kind of know what to do when they come, so we don't, just, you know, discuss and talk about the allocation that day. um, we don't have to vote this on, but i think if we, if we, modify this tweak it and then, go by it, we'll know what to do when a group comes. um, i don't think i'd, i, oh also i removed from the last resolution or the r- last proposal, i removed the part that said we will suspend parliamentary procedure for five minutes, um, just because, well you can't really put that in a resolution, if we're gonna do that we have to say, let's suspend parliamentary procedure, um, actually we talked about it at (steering,) we don't really need to, to get rid of parliamentary procedure we can have a speakers list, i just think if we had more discussion on, what we might wanna give them before we make a resolution, we'll avoid that problem, that we run into when, you know, right in the beginning of the conversation someone says i move we give 'em five hundred dollars and then we talk about, amendments and, and you know voting to, call the amendments and so on and so on and so, i, i think we can streamline this um, i throw this up, for support um, i guess we should have, uh, discussion, and then, for support, or a vote, what do you do? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. um, if you guys remember it's just um, basically this is gonna be a discussion, on, where we're giving_ which type of substance abuse program we are donating our, charitable donation to. um, i did a little bit of, research um, and i found, see i kind of added to Beth's research that she had done a couple weeks ago. um, and, i've narrowed it down to uh at least in my opinion, um, to three different organizations that we could could possibly, give our money to um, and they're, they're each of them differ, in, they... they differ in a few ways which are pretty important to, to just talk about right now so i'm basically gonna describe the three different organizations and then, open it up to discussion, um which will be followed by,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> a vote </U2>
          a vote. um, so the first one, is called um Dawn Farm Sunrise Treatment Center which is the one that i, i thought was, it was Anita Bone's favorite one over at Project Serve and i thought it was, a really cool program because, first of all it's a co-ed facility. um, they don't accept anyone under seventeen so it would be targeting, um people more our age than_ as opposed to adolescents, it's a very long-term program, in the sense that um, they they, enforce the Twelve Step          <SIC> Alcohols </SIC>
          Anonymous, type thing there, and um, they have patient treatment, um it's basically it's very personalized it's a walk-through type of, uh, program and so it's it's a really great program, um, they are nonprofit, and, they, don't receive any type of funding from the state, or anything like that it's all on donation basis. that they run their program. um, the second one is Ozone House which i'm sure a lot of you have heard of, its um, substance abuse program is more directed towards, um adolescents and teenagers so eighteen and under, um and then the third one is the Washtenaw Council on Alcoholism which is more of a, more of a pol- politically aware, um group in the sense that it's funded by the state and it's, um a lot more general, it's focused, more towards adults, and that sort of thing. um, i guess if there are any questions or if you guys would like to discuss this, feel free now.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> does anyone have any qu- mm. Lena          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i was just wondering um, you said that the Washtenaw Council one was funded by the state, so is there a need for funding? like what would our money go towards? what </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's that's </OVERLAP1>
          kind of what my, worry was with that one is just because i- i don't see a real need there, it was just a_ it was a different type of organization that i thought i would mention. our money would just go into the general pool along with all the other donations it wouldn't be directed to one specific, thing. like we couldn't say we want this money to go towards, like a program for teenagers or something like that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>

          right now like it's still going through um, it's, finishing up, um, it's, gone through, the Athletic Department i have a m- meeting this Thursday with Warde Manuel, and, he and i have been working together kind of, and, h- we're gonna go over the final logistics part, as far as the Athletic Department's concerned. if the Athletic Department, they they may endorse it they may not cuz they have logistics with the N-C-A-A that they have to worry about, so. i'm looking pessimistically, um it's still gonna happen, even if they don't endorse it because the athletes will still, there's still ath- a ver- a lot of athletic interest in doing it, and so, basically, it's, i mean, it's, it's_ we need your support just to say, you know what, this is something that L-S-and-A, S-G would like to happen like to see, happen, and also we support the purpose which i, put in the resolution as          <SEG TYPE="READING"> raise money for the, (international N-C-C-F.) </SEG>
          and so forth so forth, and also, um, we're not gonna ask you for money like this term, but, i mean, like money is kind of an issue so, i mean, i wouldn't be surprised if, i_ we- we went through the process of asking for some money, next term but i'm not gonna even talk about that now. so. yes.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i just have a quick question um, if you, look at the resolution, um, the second point says          <SEG TYPE="READING"> whereas the University of Michigan's Challenge for the Children, that was created to, </SEG>
          and then the point, the third point is,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> build the community of Ann Arbor. </SEG>

       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay well, basically, what we're, the reason why i said build the community of Ann Arbor it's because our sponsorships, we're looking for both like local and somewhat national, like, our, right now, our main, um, sponsorships we're, trying to advocate for, are like let's say Pizza House, uh, like Cava Java like what-have-you, things just in the Ann Arbor that everybody knows like where Pizza House is and so forth like that. We're also trying to get like national sponsors such as like, like a K-Mart or like a Meijer or something like that cuz, the the main point is to raise as much money as we can, and like we have nothing to lose by asking like, K-Mart for money if they wanna donate it,          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i mean, the worst thing they can say is no, and then, they have to like, live with the point that they're not helping the children.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so, that's not my issue. but, that's why, it's          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> he's trying to support the Ann Arbor community </U2>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> to waive first, to </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> c- can i make a comment? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, i would, i would s- not necessarily for the resolution but i would probably, vote not to, bypass first reads because i think first reads are important because usually that's the first time anybody's seen anything, but because, this isn't such a, life sh- changing, resolution,          <U2 WHO="S21" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> let's just take an informal vote of how many people, um, just kind of out of, parli pro whatever it doesn't matter, take an informal vote of, how many people would be willing to bypass first reads? how many people would be opposed? okay, it looks like Matt you're gonna get a lot of dissension on that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so we'll just go ahead and uh look ov- look it over and, um, if you have any, any changes that you wanna make come to me and we can, um go ahead and, discuss at the passage next week then </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay um, parliamentary procedure.          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          Matt, would you, wanna take this over?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure um, in response to, to what's been happening in the last few, meetings and in response to some, comments that have been heard, from constituents and representatives both, i'm gonna pass around this, little informational sheet which is something like the one that uh Mr Randall gave us earlier in the year, what it is basically is a primer, for the discussion that will hopefully be ensuing, from our, new council which is supposedly coming down the pipe, um, so i don't wanna step on any toes, and er, take up too much time talking about parliamentary procedure but hopefully everyone'll look this over, um, and, think about it, and, hopefully, when we get a new council they can pass us something that's a little more uh, complete, as far as Robert's Rules go i mean it it is a whole book, so i don't think we're gonna get a, copy of the book for each of us, but um, if we all become more familiar with the, types of motions the types of main motions that are allowed, and the order in which things are considered, then things'll, in my opinion run much more efficiently and much more quickly than, they are when, people are, kind of, uh, sounding off about their personal feelings on an issue, in, successive order not relating to any particular point and not addressing any previous arguments. so, um, a couple things i'd like to, call attention to, is uh specifically this first, point here, is something that, people seem to be having a lot, not ev- if, i shouldn't say that people are having a lot of trouble with but it's a very important point that... matters of, a lower rank, are considered first in other words, the most... l- the lowest order of amendment is considered first the example given here is, the amendment the amendment, must be disposed of, before, the amendment, can be voted on, and the amendment must be disposed of before the motion can be voted on. that, that's a pretty important point and, lots of time we get off track talking about, the motion when we're supposed to be talking about the amendment. so, in the interest of not stepping on anyone's toes i'm going to end this discussion now. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay. um... in response to some, of what our constituents, have um emailed, both to Tom and i, um, we're gonna try to become um, a more well-informed government on parliamentary procedure, um, when we have, when it's not running, um, effectively, people seem to, be lost and so we're trying to, make this all a more effective, so everyone's, kind of on the same page. and, like anything it's a learning process, i'm not, gonna say that i'm fluent with parli pro cuz that's not even, that's not even close to true, so, um, just, let's use the next couple of meetings, to really practice, um, doing parli pro and when we have a council it'll be a lot better. but, um, just bear with us, and um, we're learning, as you guys are learning too, so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> one final point in relation to parliamentary procedure if you look on the bottom of the back of the sheet, it says that um, you can utilize, S-A-L services this little sheet was produced by S-A-L so if you wanna go to um, the student leadership people and, go through one of their seminars you can always do that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay, thank you, um, hopefully we'll try to get an S-A-L person in here, to help us with parli pro too.          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          eventually. okay, um, po- point seventeen E the I-T-D discussion, um, this is also Matt Lane        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, now i've got another handout to pass around, and um, this one here, this, fun little item, is, a copy of, a proposal that was, presented by the Provost to the regents, that was the impetus, as far as i understand for the thirty-dollar, a person, or an (allocated) student fee, that we were assessed this year, to improve the, information, technology environment of the college, uh, I-T-D, actually has nothing to do with this committee, um, in fact one of the, key issues of the committee is how to, stay away from, I-T-D's, business, and how to, tailor, the money w- that will hopefully be spent on behalf of the students, away from the activities that I-T-D, or the services that I-T-D is providing for, the students because the fear is, if, um, as a college we do anything, to supplement I-T-D's services, they may, pull back from the services they're already providing, so, the autonomy of I-T-D is something of a problem as far as improving the i- technology environment, of the, of the campus but that's a completely separate matter, uh, the name of the committee, incidentally for, for further budget, er for further agenda, purposes, is the L-S-A Informational Technology Committee... um we will be meeting next Monday again with, Mike McPherson and the rest of the committee, Ladizwana and i, and uh we will be discussing some further issues, as far as uh what sort of response the committee has been getting back, from a letter they sent out to all the department chairs. uh the strategy that the committee has been taking to dispose of this one-point-one million dollars, is to write letters to all the committee chairs, and ask them what they, think as far as, how the money could be best spent, and we haven't gotten any response from that yet, uh so obviously the committee is in its, very early stages, next Tuesday we're going to have Mike McPherson here to speak with us, so um, after i, answer Jerry's question i can, talk about some of the main issues. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay. um, as far as some of the main issues that are, in front of the committee, some, some questions that we might be able to, tailor for, Mr McPherson who is, being kind enough to come and visit us next Tuesday, um, the key issue is the student labs we have all these student labs in all the departments and some of them, are, fostered through the department, for instance, in the political science department the lab is completely taken care of by the political science department and the college has nothing to do with it, so that's not under our purview, it says here there are currently ten structural computing labs and it lists where they are, and, how much it's cos- costing to, upgrade them on a, three-year cycle so that, that is a big issue in in the, in the committee, if we buy all these wonderful things, how much is it gonna cost to, keep replacing them and keep, uh insuring that they're continually wonderful, uh,          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          the only group so far that we've spoken with is the Language Resource Center, and Monika Dressler the director of that, center has all sorts of wonderful ideas for, our money as far as putting in, um new software that, a- allows text in foreign languages, uh at all the computing sites which i think is a, pretty solid idea, uh, as far as cost benefit goes, uh, and lots of the things overlap for instance the, L-R-C, the Language Resource Center wants to hire more technical support staff to support the students, and, the priority the key priority of the committee, is to make sure that, all the money is spent in the most, most, direct, impact, for the students, and, the key issue is is how direct does this impact have to be? how direct does it have to be for the college to spend their money on it? and, i assume that the_ tha- that's what our questions to Mr McPherson will revolve around, uh is, teaching, is training the teachers or training the, instructors, in these new methods like PowerPoint and other new software, worth our money? is that a direct enough impact on the students? or, or is, hiring technical support staff to help students, um, or to help faculty, do their business is that direct enough? is computers direct enough? is computer on faculty desks, direct enough? um, it's sort of a difficult, thing to talk about when we're at the early stage we're at seeing as we don't have any formal proposals, and seeing as the administration, is, against, us having, formal proposals and against the committee, um, ruling on formal proposals because they want to reserve, that, formalized process to their own, decision-making, bodies, so that that could be another, point of interest, to Mr McPherson um, i should also add that in addition to the one-point-one million dollars that we're, all kicking in, as individuals, at thirty dollars a pop, the Provost has also agreed to kick in six hundred and sixty thousand dollars, and curiously enough that, that pretty much just covers, the, proposal here as it's written, um, so i just encourage everyone to take a look at, these things and, think about, you know how how, how useful is a PowerPoint lecture compared to, the, the traditional lecture? is that worth us spending our money on? what sort of new, computer technology do we want in the labs, or, d- would we rather spend that money on making sure our teachers are confident, enough to, utilize this technology because, these new methods of teaching are so powerful? um, i think it's sort of up in the air, and i have my own, particular, leanings on it and as i said before, if anyone has, something to say to myself or Lena about how you'd like us to represent the college, in the community? or in the committee_ please, please say that to us, but you'll have an opportunity next week to, to say it directly to the man who's really in charge.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay Jerry </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, my question is this, um, how much, like right now, did you like take a survey or something to see like, cuz i think that one of the things is, w- how many student actually participate in the, like, in the, in the programs, that are sponsored like for PowerPoint and for Excel whatever have you? like how many students like, tend to show up to those? can you take a survey of that, or if you_ do you have general foundation of that? cuz i think, a lot of this would be, based on what is currently happening at the university i know myself, i see i'll see a sign that says, PowerPoint i'm like i know how to use it, i'm not gonna go. and then, that's just me though. maybe other people are like, would be like oh i don't know i'd like to learn, but i think that (xx) the original idea in what the students want cuz, i don't see, what would, would it, (what) would help if you were trying to improve the teaching, if kids, or if students weren't even trying to like, get that learning. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. well, the the whole, the whole, story about Pow- PowerPoint, it should be, teach our teachers, to learn this. is it a powerful enough instructional tool, that we should spend this money to teach our teachers how to use it? or is it, not as powerful a- as an instructional          <SIC> toor_ </SIC>
          tool_ or as a learning tool, that maybe some more advanced software in, in Angell Hall might be?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, so it's all a matter of where to spend the money, um, should we spend it on support staff? should we spend it on training the faculty? should we spend it on putting, computers on faculty desks? i would say definitely not, in that last instance i mean, to me that's, really a progression of getting further and further away from, a direct impact on students. and the question is, where is that, edge? where is the, drop-off so to speak as as far as w- when spending becomes, too indirect, to be using our money on it? and i think one thing that we, really should seek to, pin down, Mr McPherson on, is... will the six hundred and sixty thousand dollars that the Provost kicked in, be subject to the same, priority, restrictions, that, the money that is re- drawn from the student thirty-dollar fee is? um, so cuz i think that the administration sees the six hundred and sixty thousand dollar kick in, as, you know, their form of play money that they can, shuffle around in that budget however they want. um, so, well i think we'll have some interesting things to talk to, these people about and, hopefully we'll have some informative questions hopefully you'll take a look at this, and, do some thinking about, what would i- improve the, environment in your classes or you know maybe you can ask some people i, i don't really know what sort of regime you can employ to take a survey, um, in fact i- it's interesting that most students don't even know that they were assessed a thirty-dollar fee,          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay, um, as i said, next week um Mike McPherson's coming, um so, i am g- i'm gonna put this in Matt's lap, so if you guys have any questions that you wanna generate, that you wanna ask Tim, um, ahead of time, um, email them to Matt. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right and al- and also, Lena and i are meeting, again with the committee on Monday, morning, so we'll have a lot more to say hopefully after Monday and maybe, we can get together and put out some sort of informational email that'll give, you all some ideas of of how the process is moving along and what sort of responses what sort of proposals we're getting so that might be able to, guide your questions a little bit </U1>
