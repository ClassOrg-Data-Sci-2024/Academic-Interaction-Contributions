       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no i'm fine </OVERLAP1>
          you can        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (start with them) </OVERLAP1>
          i got here late.          <OVERLAP1> (xx) they were waiting. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> umm </OVERLAP1>
          specific questions? you have a specific question?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, everyone          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> else </OVERLAP1>
          was here first.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> (Robin?) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i have a question, (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this, right here i'm not sure_ i don't understand why we use this,          <OVERLAP1> this um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> oh oh, </OVERLAP1>
          okay so this is,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> shape factor </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> (xx) you use the shape factor when you don't know like when you have two dimensional heat transfer right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> which is the case here because you know like (heat) is going this way, it's radially going out          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          then it's it going off. okay? it's going to the surface here.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          now you can't model this as a one dimensional heat transfer you know like the, um the sort that we learned before so you, take care of, the heat transferred from the surface of the tube, to the surface of the, soil or solid or whatever here it, it is,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um by the shape factor, okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but if that's_ this shape factor is it says it's for, hollow cyl- cylinder.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um </U2>
          and that's why i don't understand why          <OVERLAP1> we use that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> oh is this for </OVERLAP1>
          the hollow cylinder? okay. i thought you were talking about this. is this the same as this?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because this is for, no this is for buried, buried cylinder. for a hollow cylinder </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's the same thing except you have R-two, except          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          so this is for a buried maybe it's not a hollow cylinder cuz this H is, this H actually          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="AUDIO DISTURBANCE"></EVENT>          yeah but what_ if you have something like this? this shape factor takes care of the heat transfer from the surface to here.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay? so what you do is you say, the formula is like this, the heat transferred from here to here, is just K of this material here,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          times the S shape factor that you have for this geometry which is this thing, times the delta-T the delta-T would be from the surface to the surface.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
          so this shape factor only takes care of um this region, from this surface to this surface. okay? that's all it does. now for the rest of it if you wanna go from here to here you have to worry about the other resistances that you have          <OVERLAP1> for example </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (this example) here? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right. this is like the internal resistance, the convection resistance inside the pipe and this is for the thickness of the pipe itself. and then, from here to here the shape factor takes care of it. and you need to_ if you want to add the resistances you have to convert the shape factor into a resistance first which is one over K-S just like this. okay? so this is the shape factor, this is the Q for it, and this is the resistance for it. and it takes care of (heat) transfer from here to here.          <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (then) </OVERLAP1>
          whenever you have a cylinder you j- you just use A,          <OVERLAP1> the log mean </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> log mean </OVERLAP1>
          yeah. if you have like multiple layers          <OVERLAP1> of some </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> what if you </OVERLAP1>
          what if like this, thickness is really really, small? can you just use the        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> if it's if it's a very small thickness and if the material is very conductive, then you can probably say that the resistance is very small because this is, this delta-R is really, small and this K is very big so this resistance is very small you neglect it in favor of the other one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so usually when you have thick, i mean thin, layer you can tell you can say that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> the resistance is very small it has to be very conductive too. you can't really say only by, the delta-R because if this thing is very small too then,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          it might not necessarily give H (xx)          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (uhuh) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so i- if delta-R is very small and it's very conductive then you can probably say the resistance is very small so it's all the uniform temperature throughout the thickness of the tube, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so there's jus- just one more question (xx) one more question like          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          if you if we have, problems that we did like at the beginning of cla- of the year,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right </U2>
          and have Hs in 'em, like can we expect that, he's gonna give us like (another one) (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah yeah you should          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so we gotta combine all </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> be able to </OVERLAP1>
          combine right. actually let me draw a picture for you think about this case, do you have an extra sheet of paper (i can) use? okay so think about this case let's say you have a box, sort of like a box here, and then there's a, pipe in it. okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> now there's another box here, and there's another pipe in it.          <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          you know the dimensions. here and here, fluid is, flowing like let's say with a velocity of, ten meters per second, and temperature is given,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          for the fluid inside. here, another fluid is flowing with a velocity of let's say two meters per second, another temperature this is T-one this is T-two is given. and for h- here, the heat transfer coefficient is given. okay? for, between the two. so we have a heat transfer coefficient for the fluid that's here, and the velocities of these. now they say, calculate the rate of heat transfer from this to this. okay? so you have one resistance for the H here, which you have to calculate from        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is this solid right here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah          <OVERLAP1> this is solid right here. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> is this materi- </OVERLAP2>
            okay.          </U2>
          so, you have one resistance here which you can calculate from the Nusselt number.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you have the Nusselt number you get the H you calculate the resistance here. then you have, probably like, you might you might wanna think about the thickness too but let's not worry about that. then from here from to here you have a shape factor which is given here.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's this </OVERLAP1>
          case right? so you use this shape factor for the resistance from here to here.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          then from here to here you have an H, so it's one over H-A area being this, and then again from here to here another shape factor from here to here, another H.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> Nusselt number, and would the Nusselt number be the same for these two or          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> no </OVERLAP1>
          because the velocities are different.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. i mean w- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> the velocities are different so you have to first check if they're in the same regime you might be able to use the same formula for them, if the re- regime is the same          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i mean they </OVERLAP1>
          they only give you like a Nusselt number of, i don't know whatever, ten.        </U1>

          i thought mm, cuz you're, it looks like          <OVERLAP1> from the, (xx) surface temperature. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but i i j- if i read the notes right it's just you need to know that this          <OVERLAP1> term is </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so if </OVERLAP1>

          yeah exactly.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, um, i think that was basically it,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> if i </OVERLAP1>
          think of something else          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i guess (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so when do we use this equation then? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> which one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> only if you know the surface temperature? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um see if it's, only_ if if you know the surface temperature it's only the first term that you need to, deal with, okay? if you ne- if you know the surface temperature and that's in your notes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's right          <OVERLAP1> here? </OVERLAP1>

          in your lecture notes. right yeah, that's the only term that you need to worry about if you know the surface temperature. if you don't know the surface temperature you can either use this whole thing or use the chart. which i would say use the chart it's easier,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          (you know) don't          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          those exponentials and        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, and so, what_ i mean like you use this if you know the, s- the surface temperature (xx) (now where does T-S come from?) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um T-one would be T-S then. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i thought this (was) T-S          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

          that if if you know this_ if you know the_ see that's the case that_ because it's the same if the formula will be di- will be different you will have T-S here then, because it's as if the H is, extremely large so that these terms drop out, correct?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> if the X is ex- extremely large, or the H, the exponential of, this minus this thing you know like          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this (thing) </OVERLAP1>
          drops out right. and then you will, um, have only this term right? and that means if the H is very very big, the surface temperature is the same as T-one. so you can put your surface temperature here. but i would say use the, th- the lecture notes cuz, it was derived for you in the lecture notes, (in here.)        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so surfa- temp- surface temperature would be T-one right? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then you would just solve it          <OVERLAP1> (for the H) </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> for </OVERLAP1>
          the first_ for the, cooling cycle you need to, do your you know like you, for this cooling cycle you need to (xx) your properties at this temperature and do your calculations based on this temperature and those (cool) properties          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> and then </OVERLAP1>
          for the heating cycle you have_ you do the same thing, so you have two different Hs          <OVERLAP1> one is </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

          so then when we, do the, plot of it we're gonna have,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> for each, for for the five, first five seconds you use the H for,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you have to check the Biot number for both cases,          <OVERLAP1> and see if it's </OVERLAP1>

          yes if it works for only one case then lumped (key) capacity is, valid for that cycle and then, you can't do lumped (key) capacity for the other cycle          <OVERLAP1> because it's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah, because som- usually how they define theta is, a nondimensionalized thing so it's actually this whole thing          <OVERLAP1> is </OVERLAP1>

          i was confused about temperature again.          <OVERLAP1> because, </OVERLAP1>

          so, are you supposed to use, conduction through it?          <OVERLAP1> or you don't </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (is it um) in in the C like this is like the same equation but except this is H-A and this          <OVERLAP1> is (C-A) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> it's A-F it's </OVERLAP1>
          the same thing. oh K, no oh okay you know what he's doing? he's, doing the_ well okay, he's um, okay he's doin- what he's doing he's saying like the heat transfer is the same, all the heat transfer that is here,          <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> comes from the base of the </OVERLAP1>
          fin right? so, this if this is conduction then this would be the, cross-sectional area of_ perpendicular to the          <OVERLAP1> direction of the fin. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so, so i </OVERLAP1>
          but i can use either one of these (equations)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes actually this is easier.          <OVERLAP1> this is much easier. as long as you know the efficiency of the fin </OVERLAP1>

          sure this i know what this is, this is cross-sectional?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah cross-sectional because whenever you talk about conduction it's minus-K times A D-T-D-X right? and that A is the area, perpendicular to the direction of heat transfer right? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> (alright?) so that that's the area that that's how it comes in the picture. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh,          <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          but then, should this, part this part is part of the, efficiency, so what happened to this (Biot number?)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> well you had the temperature profile and you took a derivative of it. right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well w- wait the Biot number, is          <OVERLAP1> less than (xx) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> and that's how this, </OVERLAP1>
          um that's how they did this because that's not_ see they have this formula for the temperature profile they take the derivative of it and they get this. okay? and since this A-M is not the same as this, A-F and since this K is not the same as this H you don't expect, to have all the terms          <OVERLAP1> here (like) they just cancel out. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> except you're gonna guess three temperatures. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> which are, which temperatures? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the temperature_ like th- if this is the inside of the insulation the temperature on the inside of the insulation inside of the window and the outside of the window. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so outside of the insulation you mean. not inside of the insulation. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> in between the space. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> correct          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so but </OVERLAP1>
          these three temperatures are all related right? it th- it's not that there's three independent temperatures you          <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          guess them independently first, but then they're all related t- through the Q because at steady state the Q is the same that goes through, all of them right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so, you guess the three temperatures but, what you can calculate all three in one step, right? in each step of your iteration you can calculate all three different temperatures. because if you know the Q, right? you can jump from, the inside of the room to the outside of the, um plastic, and calculate this temperature. and the with the same Q you can jump from here to here, you know to the inside of the window and calculate the temperature of the inside of the window with the same Q you can, jump from the inside of the room to the outside of the window, so all three temperatures can be          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> dependent on this thing, here. yeah. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> calculated in each iteration step. right? </OVERLAP1>
          and then you, then the new, three temperatures that you calculate are are your next guesses. you put 'em in, into your next step of iteration.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so it's basically the same thing as part A it's just like three different temperatures that you have to guess. and as long as you guess them, you know like physically they're close to, what they're really          <OVERLAP1> going to be </OVERLAP1>

          but don't do the same ce- cells go down. you know what i mean? like don't do_ like if you guess the three tha- temperatures and you put 'em here, don't say that these three, are, put into this cell again. put 'em in in the next, row. you know what i mean?        </U1>

         </U2>
          and, by knowing Q you can cal- recalculate the temperatures that you guessed, and put 'em back into the next step.          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>

            Brandon          </U2>
          kinda listening in, what you were talking about, i was looking for rho as well, so you take, you said rho velocity equals uh, the... the mass flux        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah,          <OVERLAP1> check out, check </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mass (flow) (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          the units and see what it gives you,          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> rho </OVERLAP1>
          velocity.        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":18" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's, kilograms per meters squared per second? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah, so it's kilograms per meters squared per second it means that it's like a mass flux right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because flux is, quantity per unit time per unit area.          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right? so that's a mass flux going into the tube.          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so, if you can calculate the mass flux somehow, okay you can get around, you know like calculating rho-V, calculating rho individually and multiplying it by V, now you know the mass flow rate in here right? the total          <OVERLAP1> mass flow rate </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and you know the area that it's going through,          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          the perpendicular to the flow. um, so you can calculate the mass flux right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> just like </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so then you calculate </OVERLAP1>
          the mass flux and then, do you know the (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> well rho-V itself is,          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          the mass flux.          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you don't know the ve- you don't need to know the velocity do you?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm... no,          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
          rho-V is the mass flux and you calculated the mass flux why would you need the velocity?          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you know the rho-V,          <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          and that's all you need i mean you put it_ you say rho-V and then you'd multiply it by D divided by the viscosity gives you Reynolds number.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

          um, let's see. so the first one i'm considering, what'd i do? what page? trying to think of my setup. oh i find Reynolds because it's a flow, so it... so then you can find          <SIC> Nusslet </SIC>
          , and know what H i- or, Nusselt number what equation to use.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay, mhm </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then, you just set the Q equations equal to each other, </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> to the </OVERLAP1>

          so then uh and then this is from inlet to outlet.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> exactly </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i i suppose i should, define that a little better          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          better but, yeah i put that in there.          <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          so delta-T-two, is        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is the, inlet          <OVERLAP1> (to outlet) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> so this is </OVERLAP1>
          your T-out? seventy-four?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> i think it's a little bit, low. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> i'm not sure but          <OVERLAP1> i think, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          because you know i um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it can't go much higher though cuz it's only seventy-seven. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> well, this seventy-seven is supposed to be the average, somehow, you know like, the average of the bulk temperature.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          so it          <OVERLAP1> should </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          be, so your outlet should be, around ninety degrees Celsius or so. so just check your calculations it's, your method is right.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          but just check your calculations and see if you, um did everything right. this should          <OVERLAP1> be </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          fine...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh because, like when i take a delta-T, of uh, when i have a like, this delta-T, is that from ninety-eight, not to seventy-seven cuz that's bulk? is that where i'm doing it wrong? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> no i think that's right.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay </U2>
          so because it's it's to the average bulk temperature.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay it          <OVERLAP1> is to (that) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          ninety-eight, is your wall          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> wall </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> temperature </OVERLAP1>
          right? so ninety-eight to seventy-seven is this one,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then this one is inlet to outlet.          <OVERLAP1> inlet </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          being sixty. it should be fine then, i don't know.          <OVERLAP1> the final answer_ </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i'll i'll just look it over </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah your method is right and i don't know the final answer but it should be around ninety degrees Celsius because, um, that's why we gave you this average.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          okay because the physical properties have to be at the average bulk temperature right?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and we give it to you at seventy-seven so it should be, around ninety.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          so then i could find an equation for Nusselt.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> correct </U2>
          and, i got P at_          <SIC> Prandalt </SIC>
          from there,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          i have, that, so then i can find an H.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay, and is this an average H or a local H? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it'd be average. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think, the equation          <EVENT DESC="LOOKING IN BOOK"></EVENT>          (xx) that's a good question. uh yeah page (two-forty-nine.)          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          (oh yeah)          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          both parallel looks like Nusselt          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          i don't know yeah i i'll just used this, it said for turbulent region, yeah and this is for R-E-L okay so yeah it should work.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right. now, that thing_ you remember we talked about this in the class, that this is for the case where, all of your heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh,          <OVERLAP1> oh so i should do a laminar (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> so that's, that's what they say </OVERLAP1>
          like the completely turbulent, region.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          so this is a, fo- only for the case where all the heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          now in this problem part of it is in the,          <OVERLAP1> laminar </OVERLAP1>
          regime right?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          now, the way that you wanna go, about this is, you need to calculate a, you need to calculate an average H, for the whole thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do you, kinda, do you use like a what a (level ruler or covar) or like because y- you know a set length's gonna be in laminar and a set's gonna be in turbulent, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then you take the average, like they're weighted, or something          <OVERLAP1> or (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          you, okay but considering the turbulent, how do you want to consider the turbulent part say that, um, tell me how you want to consider the turbulent part.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> do </OVERLAP1>
          you want to put_ what kind of L do you wanna put in there and what kind of, Reynolds number do you wanna put in          <OVERLAP1> there? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh, </OVERLAP1>
          obviously you (couldn't,) your L would be, if i remember right it's the entire region isn't it? when you calculate,          <OVERLAP1> Reynolds? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> yes </OVERLAP1>
          okay lemme, give you a hint, you work on this, because it's not, you can't really see it, unless you start working on it mathematically.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (get) another sheet here          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <EVENT DESC="TAKING OUT SHEET OF PAPER"></EVENT>       </U1>

          is this_ were you gonna turn this in?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah oh well i can find some more paper </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> here, just (take this one off)          <EVENT WHO="S15" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <EVENT DUR=":04 " DESC="PAUSE WHILE REMOVING PAPER"></EVENT>          okay, so, wha- the f- the way we calculate the average heat transfer coefficient is we just, integrate it over the whole thing over the whole length right? so we say H-average, is just, one over length, okay the integral, from zero to L, of H-local-D-X. okay? this is          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> how </OVERLAP1>
          we calculate the average right? and we have to mul- di- divide this by L because we're multiplying it by a dimension here, (like) in the integral.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          H is varying with X so we inte- we integrate it from zero to L, over X and then we divide by L to get a right dimension, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> now, the way we wanna do it here we want to break this, because we have two different equations for i- local heat          <OVERLAP1> transfer </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          coefficient in the          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> laminar </OVERLAP1>
          and turbulent regime, so we say H average is just one over L, and then we, do the, do the laminar part separately, X-C being X-critical.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and          <OVERLAP1> you find that. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> that's where_ </OVERLAP1>
          yes, that's where it becomes turbulent          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so H-A-X for laminar, D-X, from zero to X-C, plus, from X-C to the L,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          H-X for turbulence, D-X okay?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          now, you don't really need to do this, plus, you don't know the, local heat transfer coefficient for the turbulent right? they don't give it to you they just give you the, average one right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> this one is, the laminar one is just, point-three-three-two, Reynolds to the one half, Prandtl to the one-thirds,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right? but this one you don't know. you don't know the local one they just give you the average one          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay but you know, first of all this thing you know when you integrate it what kind of, um what kind of a constant it gives you here because it's done for you right?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> correct? </OVERLAP1>
          the the laminar part it just gives you point-six-six-four, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so this one you're all set, you jus- you know this point-six-six-four Reynolds, to the one-half and this Reynolds is at X-C,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          and Reynolds at X-C you know what it is it's just five times ten-to-the-fifth right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah, yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because that's where it becomes turbulent          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          so you know this part this part is_ you're all set.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          now on this part, you you don't know this H-X you don't know the,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (constant) </U2>
          um local heat transfer coefficient          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          for the turbulent part but you know, if you,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          if you calculate it from zero to L-H-X-turbulent, D-X, it gives you point-oh-three-six-six Reynolds to the point-eighths Prandtl to the, one-thirds right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so what will happen if you calculate from X-C to L? just think about it's very          <OVERLAP1> easy, you can find </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um, it would it'd be half </OVERLAP1>
          wouldn't it? or am i thinking it wrong?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> no, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> wait </OVERLAP2>
            X-C          </U2>
          the only thing is,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh oh oh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you know, you d- you have to, you have to think about how X comes into picture in an in, heat transfer coefficient it's only through Reynolds right?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          so if you integrate it from zero to L, you will have Reynolds-to-the-point-eight.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          if you have_ if you calculate it from X-C to L, wha- what kind of a, Reynolds number will you get? i mean, what will be the, form of this? the constant will be the same.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
          you know when you integrate it it gives you this. but then the Reynolds number, will take a, different form just think about it,          <OVERLAP1> for a second and se- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh i would </OVERLAP1>
          think, just to the one or is that?          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> uh the power </OVERLAP1>
          shou- probably shouldn't change          <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> wait the </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> no the_ </OVERLAP1>
          even this is not changing the form of it is changing just just how you, calculate it. um think about how y- when you when you integrate this you say that's the integral of this and then evaluate them at the two limits, right?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          and you get this, correct?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because lower limit is zero. if the lower limit is not zero, what would you get? think about it a little bit          <OVERLAP1> i i'll </OVERLAP1>

          so we can't use this right          <OVERLAP1> away now, </OVERLAP1>

            yeah          </U2>
          okay? but, let's say if we wanted to go from the inside of the room all the way to the outside.          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so we wan- we wanted to put the delta-T that you put in here what kind o- what          <OVERLAP1> modifications </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          do we have to put in here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you just have to, add a, natural convection          <OVERLAP1> (to it.) okay. </OVERLAP1>

          have to add the natural convection right?          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and natural convection itself, depends on the temperature of the window.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          right?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because it, it's it depends on the delta-T that you have, between the vertical plate and the bulk          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          so, not knowing that temperature you can't really do anything, right now. okay? so, but let's say if we guess that temperature, let's see where we can go. if          <OVERLAP1> we </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          guess this outside temperature we can get this H right? and then we can calculate the Q going from here to here.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> we can calculate the Q. now, once we calculate the Q, we can say, that same Q goes from the inside, to the right surface, through the outside of this, which is this formula.          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then recalculate that temperature.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right and check your T and if it's not the same T then you do it all over          <OVERLAP1> again. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          put that, che- if you get_ you get a new tem- uh you get a new temperature for the outside of the glass right? with that new temperature calculate the heat transfer coefficient here again, do the same thing again.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so the first the first Q you calculate is just from the outside glass, to the outside, air, from like here to here using natural convection? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you can do that you can do that if you want you can jump from here to here you can you can do whichever you want because the Q is the same.          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they're </OVERLAP1>
          all in series right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so you have the same Q you can either go from here to here you_ or you can go from here to here. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but the H you calculate from natural convection is just from here, to here right? </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> do </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> when you have air </OVERLAP1>

          and they have different temperatures you know that air starts moving right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> it starts circulating probably.          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> going </OVERLAP1>
          down on the cold side going up on the, hot side          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>

          but the only thing we were wondering is that it gives you a characteristic width,          <OVERLAP1> of </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          that air. so, it seems like if there was an H, you know does that matter how wide it is? it seems like it would,          <OVERLAP1> (make a) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> it does. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so that          <OVERLAP1> characteristic </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but it seems hard </OVERLAP1>

          because you have these two plates at two different temperatures so air starts rising on the, col- on the hot side and then, going down on the cold side so it'll start circulating          <OVERLAP1> like this. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so it's like the same thing that you          <OVERLAP1> had </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and it was circulating so your characteristic dimension would be the, gap          <OVERLAP1> dimension. </OVERLAP1>

          you know like the, you know the dimensions you can calculate the physical properties if you know the temperatures. so          <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (right) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          guess these three let's say,          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and then you calculate this H this H. now knowing the Hs can you calculate the Q?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>

         </U2>
          so you can go al- from here to here          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (okay) </U2>
          or you can go from here to here or from here to here          <OVERLAP1> whatever </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          you wanna do. you can calculate them,          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          okay? so, in the first step if you guess, T-one T-two T-three, you can then go and calculate them, all of them.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

          it's exactly the same thing as part A it's just like th- three different things that you don't know and you gue- guess all of them at once, and calculate all of them in one step.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay? and using a spreadsheet is much easier because you just put the formulas in you can say okay whatever H you calculated for here, put it in this formula for you know like resistances in series, go from here to here calculate this go from here to here calculate this go from here to here, calculate this,          <U2 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and once you get these three put 'em in the next row, T-one T-two T-three that you just calculated do the same thing until they converge.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U1>

          three that you need. because this T where's inside? this is H-inside right? yeah this T you really don't need,          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U2>
          because you kno- you need these Ts to calculate your natural convection, coefficient right?        </U1>

          on the second problem, i was wondering, for, if that's an okay equation circuit for that kinda (it's Prandtl.) that's where i went off of is this, and i got to, there.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um lemme see what exactly you did you're saying energy over time is, Q over A          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> thanks Ali </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> Q is </OVERLAP1>
          on- sure. we'll see you in the lecture. um is this Q? what is this Q? oh okay so if you say, let's see, okay so this Q looks like it's a flux right?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i guess you should.          <PAUSE DUR=":14" ></PAUSE>          yeah since this is melting this would be at, zero degrees. (so) water (is at,) so this is gonna have, (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay yeah. so, you're saying that, okay dra- show me where the conduction is from, where          <OVERLAP1> from where to where. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i guess it wouldn't </OVERLAP1>
          because, as soon as um, the energy would just have to pass through, the water's resistance, i guess to get in there?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah, the energy goes through the_ yeah through resistance for the convection and then gets to the surface and that's          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah and that's_ </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> all we worry about. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah          <OVERLAP1> okay yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> right? so we don't </OVERLAP1>
          really need          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> 'm'm, 'm'm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that conduction right? </OVERLAP1>
          okay, so that's fine. now, so you say, the only, thing that we need here is just like the H of water, times the area of course to get the total Q not the flux,          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then we can relate that to the energy that is, used for melting the ice. okay. the solution scheme is absolutely correct, the only thing is how do you get this H then? H for water?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i wasn't sure because i know that they're traveling together so i thought,          <OVERLAP1> maybe </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> they're not </OVERLAP1>
          traveling together the, the, um, the ice is being towed. so the ice is traveling at the, speed that we gave you, but water is stagnant... okay? so there's i- the the ice is traveling in stagnant water. so what does that look like, in terms of what you've learned before?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i would          <PAUSE DUR=":15" ></PAUSE>          hm, i wanna say natural convection, but i don't think that that's it.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> natural convection is um, okay natural convection is when the, if this thing were,          <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> were </OVERLAP2>
            still          </U2>
          stagnant too right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but it's not </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> it's not it's moving.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          so if you have a plate that is moving in the, water, if you start moving with the plate, what will you see? from the observer's, point of view? you know like the observer's moving with the, with the plate. okay? so from the observer's point of view the plate is stagnant now. correct? if it's moving with the same          <OVERLAP1> speed </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          as the, plate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then the water would be moving          <OVERLAP1> (if) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          you were at that          <OVERLAP1> point. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          does that look like then?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> then that looks like flow, past a, flat plate. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> exactly. exactly. so it looks like flow over, over a flat plate.          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and you know some Nusselt number equation for that and you can get the H right?          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay            <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          is, um this th- you know like the physics of the problem doesn't depend on the refer- reference frame that you choose.          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> 'm'm </U2>
          so you say okay my referen- reference frame is moving with the, iceberg now. so it's as if the iceberg is stagnant and the water is flowing past, the iceberg right?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's um, we're we're doing multistage batch distillation,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right </U2>
          and so we're finding like, how much distillate we can get at a certain          <EVENT DESC="S21 RETURNS HOMEWORK SHEET"></EVENT>          thank you,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S21" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> thanks </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> at a certain um, mole fraction a certain purity,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          stuff, and they want us to compare the amounts that we can get at constant reflux ratio and constant distillate composition.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> ho- </OVERLAP1>
          so for like both of those methods, it's almost kinda like guess and check like you gotta draw a bunch of different operating lines          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right            <OVERLAP2> right. uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and stuff, </OVERLAP1>
          and then you've gotta calculate the integrals, like the areas under the curves of like,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> wh- of which curves? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, what you have is, you graph one over X-D minus X-W where this is the mole fraction of the distillate          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          this is, mole fraction left in the liquid          <OVERLAP1> (of the plume) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          which is X-W and you're gonna end up with graphs that look like that          <OVERLAP1> kinda, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and then you have to go from like certain values, you know that you determine,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah </U2>
          from another graph, and calculate this area but like we don't know how to do that, on Excel so we use_ we've been using like the trapezoidal rule some people are using the midpoint rule        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um trapezoidal is always better,          <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          always the best.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i use the trapezoidal. but then like i mean, i like had to estimate cuz i didn't wanna just use like the values that we had cuz that'd only be like two or three values, so i like estimated points on the graph you know, it's just like, you know everyone's values are gonna like, range all over the          <OVERLAP1> place. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
          you know, when you integrate, you don't really introduce much error. you          <OVERLAP1> know that? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> really? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          yeah, if you integrate, if you have like a little bit of error for these things it usually doesn't matter.          <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          know like integration is the, one with the least um round-off error, is the you know like operation with the least round-off error.          <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> really </U2>
          yeah, so it shouldn't be the, i mean as long as your points are, pretty close you know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well there was another one too we had to graph, okay this is the Y equals X line this is the equilibrium line, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> correct </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we had to graph lines of constant reflux ratio so line of constant slope, at different X-Ds,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> uhuh </U2>
          so like we'd start over here and, you know pretend those are parallel          <OVERLAP1> somehow, right. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> oh right right okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          well, i mean these are so close together,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right </U2>
          and stuff and then you've gotta estimate these points right here and then like step off a certain number of stages and          <OVERLAP1> estimate </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> correct </OVERLAP2>

          right right        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then like, but to, to generate a graph, that's um, that looks like this so we have points on this side and on this side, you have to draw a line starting almost at one.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah, yeah </U2>
          and then once you get up here it's like, how could_ how can          <OVERLAP1> you (xx) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> right right i know </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> so that's </OVERLAP1>
          why it was it was like, frustrating cuz it's like you tried so hard to do it perfectly, and you're just like ugh, anyways        </U1>

          i'm not sure if i'm going about this the right way. so for thi- for the first problem, (xx) interaction the first step you should take is find the heat transfer coefficient, um for the l- oil, using, a laminar_ (if you c-) f- figure out the Reynolds numbers below.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then do you need to take into account, the heat transfer coefficient of the condensing steam or is that irrelevant?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um </U2>
          or is that, is that just to show you that that's what is keeping the pipe temperature constant?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> for the steam you mean for the steam outside of the pipe? </U1>

          the pipe. so we don't really care what's happening outside, because we know the temperature inside and that's wh- all we need for here to calculate the new wall you know,          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, and then after you find the heat transfer coefficient, um do we know a relationship to find like, the temperature like along the, uh length of the pipe? </U1>

          what you do have is this thing, right?          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
          Nu- Nusselt number. now, why do you think you need a temperature um, as a function of X, as a function of Z, over X or whatever you call that length?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because i thought it would be changing like along the whole length of          <OVERLAP1> the pipe. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually no but i put down the ones that were in the book. but they're pretty close i got like, (i got) like point-four-oh-five and i got, point-three-nine-five. </U1>

          the, what'd i get for my answer? cuz the Y average depends on your, your X that you put in,          <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so, basically i got point-three-nine-five so i just rounded up to point-four-oh-five.          <U2 WHO="S19" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and then when you put that in you're, gonna get the same one as you do in the book, for your Y average.        </U1>

          you, how do you, okay, how do you want to use this? this is the H for inside the pipe          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> inside the pipe </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right temperature of the bulk, correct? </U1>

          now        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so this seventy-seven degrees is th- like the T-bulk that we're assuming for the physical properties but it's not necessarily the temperature coming out. </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          okay so, so relating the Q to the change of temperature of the oil,          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          as it goes in the pipe, what can you say? you can say that, this, this Q is transferred to the oil so it raises its temperature to          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> from </OVERLAP1>
          the inlet to some outlet temperature,          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? how do you write that, mathematically?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> th- the change in Q? umm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> it's not a change in Q it's just a change in temperature. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> it's the same Q, just raises the temperature of the oil right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so the, thing that's raising the temperature of the oil would be the, condensing the steam right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or </OVERLAP1>
          it's not_ that still doesn't take into account does it?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right bu- it's the condensing the steam, it's it's the condensation of the steam but we don't care about that          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> don't care about that </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> because we don't </OVERLAP1>
          have any information on the steam either.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          but, if you, you want to say this is the energy that is transferred to the oil.          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (mhm) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
          now, this energy increases the temperat- temperature of the oil from some temperature to some other temperature right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay so how do you say, Q is equal to, um, the increase in the temperature of the oil times something? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> increase in temperature of the oil (xx) </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          you know the increase in temperature how you calculate the Q?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> increase in temperature, would it_ wouldn't be through conduction would it?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>

         <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          um, we're talking about the increase of temperature, with time let's say. okay we're not talking about the conduction. actually i'm not explaining it good to you let me think of a better way          <OVERLAP1> to explain it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's probably like </OVERLAP1>
          obvious.          <OVERLAP1> mm </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          lemme, just draw you a picture. let's say, i have, this material, okay? initially i have some T-one some temperature inside of this T-one, and then i give some heat to it.          <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and then the temperature inside is T-two, at some other time.          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          how can i calculate how much energy i gave to this?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm would it be like, accumulated uh, generation? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> correc- no it's not generation. it's not generation. generation is only when you have reaction. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right okay so it'd be, amount leaving equals, accumulation. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> accumulation right.          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          accumulation what what did we have for accumulation what kin- what form did we have?        </U1>

          C-P is joules per kilogram Kelvin, and then delta-T will be in Kelvin          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

          so Kelvins cancel we have joules per kilogram.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so we just do the mass? </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> this is </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> so use </OVERLAP1>
          M-dot. so, this is the M-dot-C-P delta-T of oil          <U2 WHO="S22" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          (but) so for this, the_ i mean basically you're saying these two equal to each other and this delta-T is this, temperature bulk inlet minus temperature bulk out, or the, other way around?        </U1>

          yes, so it's like an average delta-T correct.          <OVERLAP1> yes. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you're saying, solve for basically the same, T-bulk out okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yep, that's all you need. okay. you have a question? </U1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh we just had_ </OVERLAP1>
          real quick. okay, so, how you were saying that these Hs, um, but this equation's actually, or,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> Nusselt's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's this, </OVERLAP1>
          yeah that's Nusselt so you, you just have to multiply it by K over L like this to get the H.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay now we're just checking, um, the L will be, for like laminar, wouldn't it be zero to X-C,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so your, L-is X-C </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and then, turbulent would </OVERLAP1>
          be, X-C, to L right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you're getting actually one N- Nusselt number for the whole thing, averaging like this.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> ye- </U2>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i th- oh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so your          <OVERLAP1> L </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well y- </OVERLAP1>
          you've got two different equations though right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah but you put 'em in here and then you get just one H, one average H for the          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whole </OVERLAP1>
          thing,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so you don't really need to break anything apart anymore, like you don't need to          <OVERLAP1> break </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          the solution, in two different solutions anymore. um, what i mean is, let's say this is the average H and if i put it in the equation for Nusselt i get the Nusselt average, is this H average times the total L,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah, alright </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> or sorry, times the K or times the total L. times the total L, right divided by K.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
          so that total L again cancels out,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so this L, for each situation the L will be, total L. </U1>

         </U2>
          i see what you're saying,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> Nusselt equals that </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay, so you're saying </OVERLAP1>
          that would be H and that would be the Nusselt right um...          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          are you saying that when you, calculate the average Nusselt number,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it seems like when          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> for here </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you cal- </OVERLAP1>
          calculate Nusselt, you're looking only at the whole th- or just the segment, like you're no- if, if it's laminar you're only going from, this point to this point and then for the turbulent you'd go from this point to this point          <OVERLAP1> for your </OVERLAP1>

          that's true.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because it seems like that would be a way that it's weighting it too because like if like, if this part's small,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          then, it will, take in account, by this L.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> actually </OVERLAP1>
          times point-three-three-two, Reynolds to the one-halves Prandtl to the one-third correct?          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

            mhm          </U2>
          so, and then H-X for turbulent is K over,        </U1>

         </U2>
          the big X whatever it is because, you say if it's turbulent, if you're talking about a local, heat transfer coefficient          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          (xx) yes it's L, L minus X-C.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> times point_ and there's a coefficient here which you're not given it's two-nine-six actually, (not) two-point-eight, so this is the coefficient that you actually put in here but you don't really need to know it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh really? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because you know when you integrate it you'll get this and that's all you need to know.          <OVERLAP1> right you know </OVERLAP1>

          so, instead of like doing this as two, you can just do it a w- as one like, they're, never mind.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          yeah okay.          <OVERLAP1> because, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          if you evaluate this two points you cou- you could get that equation is that what you're saying?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> if i evaluate, these two points i can get,          <OVERLAP1> this equation? </OVERLAP1>

          yeah you'd end up with that equation is that what you're saying?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> no no no i'm saying this is the equation for the local one that you put in there          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          then when you integrate it you get this.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> but you actually don't need it because you know when you integrate it what kind of, constant you get here. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so you don't really need to know the constant you just have to know, what kind of functionality it will have for, Reynolds because you're integrating differently, and, you've_ well we talked about this this will be Reynolds to the point-eight at the end minus Reynolds to the point-eight, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> at the transition point,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and um, then that gives you... K-H          <PAUSE DUR=":17" ></PAUSE>          you know what's easier? what you can do is you can just calculate an average Nusselt number. say Nusselt number is um, one over L, Nusselt average is one over L, times the integral of zero to X-C of Nusselt, for laminar, D-X, plus X-C to L, Nusselt for turbulent, D-X, so you won't have to worry about those rearranging those X and L and everything.          <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          an equation for this is given as this thing now. right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so you          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> just </OVERLAP1>
          stick this in here, and then you stick the other one and this one in here,          <OVERLAP1> and then you </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay so </OVERLAP1>
          you just use the two locals? or, or wait        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah the two          <OVERLAP1> locals </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and then you know when you integrate them how_ what kind of co- coefficient they give you, so from here you say, from here you say that, so the Nusselt average is one over L, for this part i know it gives me six-six-four, Reynolds at X-C to the one-halves Prandtl to the one-thirds, okay?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          plus, um, the point-oh-three-six-six that i had,          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Reynolds </OVERLAP1>
          to the point-eight, Prandtl to the one-third this thing evaluated at X-C, and L, correct?          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yep </OVERLAP2>

         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          and then that gives you the average Nusselt number. and then          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> once you know the average Nusselt number </OVERLAP1>
          you can find tw- your avera- average          <OVERLAP1> H. </OVERLAP1>

          now Ravi pointed something out which is which actually is very interesting that, he calculated where it becomes transition,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          where it becomes turbulent the transition point, and he found out that it was only two-point-seventy-three meters inside the thing.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          for the most part it's actually turbulent.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so in i- just just using this equation, just using like the average, turbulent for the          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whole </OVERLAP1>
          thing,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> won't introduce much </OVERLAP1>
          error.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          i assume because it's only two-point-seventy-three          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> meters </OVERLAP1>
          in and it's one kilometer long.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so for the most part it's actually turbulent. so, i would say if you, if you don't want to do this,          <EVENT WHO="S15" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          just put the ran- put the turbulent one in. i will talk to the grader and make sure that,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          know they_ cuz, your answer will be very close actually.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          because it_ i mean for most part it's actually turbulent right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think          <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          what i did.          <OVERLAP1> yeah i just did </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah that's what i did too. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          turbulent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay then just don't worry about it.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          but but um          <OVERLAP1> if you want to write that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's nice to know. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yeah.          <OVERLAP1> but if you want two write that </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm just to see (it) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          just make sure you do_ you add this part to          <OVERLAP1> it </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          that you calculate where it becomes, turbulent and you say, because for most part it's turbulent that's how we do it.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          but this is this would be the, general way to do it if          <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          not turbulent for the most part.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          basically this equation, if you divide it comes into play if it's maybe like five meters long or something. because it's so big, that's why, you could ignore it.          <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> cuz for,          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> for a </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          two-point-seventy-three meters is laminar and then for one kilometer          <OVERLAP1> (then) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

         <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          is turbulent. so it's          <OVERLAP1> basically </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          turbulent everywhere.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> for the last part um when you're trying to figure out, D-D D-T, um basically what i was doing was just taking the Q and dividing it by the, um latent heat fusion, and then saying that that was my D-M D-T,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          and then figuring out D-D D-T by replacing M with rho-V and then replacing, V with L-W-D          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> that's exactly </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> now, check that </OVERLAP1>
          calculation though because i'm not sure i mean he told me that it was two-point-seventy-three.          <U2 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> i've </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so check </OVERLAP1>
          it, if it is that small,          <OVERLAP1> then you can do that. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S17" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> then we can just keep it </OVERLAP1>

          question that i have. i won't go over.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay, let me actually_ if, see if you can </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> can i ask you one question          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> sure, no </OVERLAP1>
          problem.          <OVERLAP1> mhm </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          this is for problem number two, and i was wondering, if the area to use when you're using this, is just the whole surface area. so that it's all exposed to the water?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> but we're only talking about the          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> or, </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> bottom </OVERLAP1>
          surface.          <U2 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> all surfaces </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          we're talking about the, Q that goes through the bottom. right? so that's only the bottom.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S18" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, thank you. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> sure </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> i basically, i basically have it done but i just wanted to run it by you so you make sure that, i was, doing it right, so for the first problem what i did is assumed, that to be my, bulk f- b- bulk, temperature so my T-L was that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          no you're not supposed to do this.          <OVERLAP1> this is what you're supposed to calculate later okay? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> what_ but no no alright, yeah, okay, </OVERLAP1>
          yeah and then i recalculated, to that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay how did you recalculate          <OVERLAP1> it (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> i well, </OVERLAP1>
          first i, calculated my Nusselt number from the equation, from the values given,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          uh i didn't know about this G, the G is the mass flow rate over the area,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> yeah it's the mass flux </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i found that </OVERLAP1>
          on the book,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> yeah because it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i don't </OVERLAP1>
          understand what it is.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay i'll tell you what it is um, do you know what um, V times A do you know what this is?          <OVERLAP1> the velocity times area. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> velocity times the area </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          what does that          <OVERLAP1> give you? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> that should </OVERLAP1>
          give you flow rate mass flow rate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> no, volume flow rate. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> vol- that's right          <OVERLAP1> volume (and area) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> exactly </OVERLAP1>
          right? so that's volume flow rate we call it this.          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          so if you multiply this by rho, what does it give you?          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> (a rho) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> rho </OVERLAP1>
          times velo- this, will give you          <OVERLAP1> what? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> that'll </OVERLAP1>
          give you, your mass flow rate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> exactly so M-dot. so so for_ from here we can say that, rho times V times A is just M-dot correct? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> okay so that's what you're          <OVERLAP1> doing there. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> now, now </OVERLAP1>
          if you divide, both sides by A you can say rho-V is just M-dot divided by A,          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          that's the (formula)          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> that's rho-V </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> which is that one there, and then that's that comes out to that and just plug and chug,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          and i get that as my, out- final outlet.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay </U2>
          and then that is ninety-eight percent of what i had assumed,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> fine </OVERLAP1>
          you don't even need to, do this part. you actually say okay, seventy-seven, things are given, i just use them and i calculate my outlet          <OVERLAP1> temperature </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes but this is when your whole heat transfer is occurring in the turbulent regime. which means, if you have a situation like this, this is the plate right? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and then there's flow, there's flow going over it right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> oh there is flow going_ i didn't know you see, i assumed that the iceberg was basically floating because if you assume actual physical conditions of a, of the iceberg you would have shrinkage, on all s- all directions you wouldn't, have          <OVERLAP1> just decrease in (xx) </OVERLAP1>

          yeah we're not worrying about that we're just saying okay y- you're saying flow is below it.          <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          not that's not what i'm talking about          <OVERLAP1> i'm </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          just saying like what kind of phy- physical situation they're saying.          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>
          they're saying let's say f- flow is over this,          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          then, so the boundary layer starts to form, and then at some point it becomes turbulent, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> from here it's turbulent. now, this equation holds when, all of the heat transfer starts when the tur- when the, um, viscous boundary layer is already turbulent.          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> okay </U2>
          what i          <OVERLAP1> mean is, </OVERLAP1>

         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> right </U2>
          what i mean is, let's say you switch the temperature at this point to some other temperature          <OVERLAP1> T-S. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and from, here this is T-infinity here is T-infinity so there's no heat transfer in the laminar regime,          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> right </U2>
          the heat transfer starts, when, when the flow is already turbulent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay? so the heat transfer starts when the flow is already turbulent. then you can use this equation. for the          <OVERLAP1> case that we have </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> how do i, </OVERLAP1>
          i mean, the way that i thought about it was, tell me if i'm wrong i mean, i figured out the Reynolds number,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U2>
          and then that that's a huge Reynolds number          <OVERLAP1> that i'm getting. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">         <OVERLAP1> but it's that_ </OVERLAP1>

          oh that's at the end of the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> plate </OVERLAP1>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> because you're putting the L the total          <OVERLAP1> L in there right? okay, so this this </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">         <OVERLAP1> right that's right which is a thousand meters or something. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> you know that it's turbulent here but it doesn't mean that it's turbulent          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> all the w- okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> alright </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> so it's laminar for some part and then it starts to become turbulent, right? so for the first part of the thing it's laminar. but, i would say do something. go and check, where it becomes laminar. um, where it where it tran- where the          <OVERLAP1> transition point is. </OVERLAP1>

          so you can just like, calculate it right away you can say this if rho-V-X          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the recession </OVERLAP1>
          rate is          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> yes </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          it's not a differential equation it's just          <OVERLAP1> straight out, just calculate </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> no no no. it's straight. yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          from this Q down to that and multiply it          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          it'll come out okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> this one, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> i think i know how to do it, i wanna run it through,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you, </OVERLAP1>
          i'm gonna do uh Q is equal to, i'm gonna say, lemme see it's, (there.) Q is equal to one over H-naught, ah what is the equation (xx) A, plus one over K-A, i say that right? over_ no, ay yai yai. well i i d- it's the it's the one with the, and then, the thing is that i know that this value i know this value but i_ this is the one that i'm gonna calculate from the vertical, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes, correct </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> this is J_ H-ou- outside. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> and that's that's the one that you say we should iterate on? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> um, yes but your equation is not correct your equation is like this it's delta-T over          <OVERLAP1> this thing. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> right right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so delta-T_ in delta-T you don't know T-naught,          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>
          T-outside,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> right? that's called_ that's T-naught. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and this delta-T you don't know T-naught, and, in this H also you don't know T-naught. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> right,          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR">           <OVERLAP2> okay? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          that's why you need to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> that's why you say if you guess first, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> a T-naught </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> if you guess a T-naught you can calculate this, and then you can calculate Q from Q you can calculate T-naught back. </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> oh okay, right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay? so you guess a T-naught first, and then you calculate your H for outside,          <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>
          right? and then knowing H you can calculate the Q.          <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          you put it in here. and then once you calculate Q then you put the Q back from here to here, and calculate this T-naught again.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> alright </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> and then you iterate. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> alright okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="FAR"> okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S23" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> alright thank you very much. this T-naught is outside right?          <OVERLAP1> is a </OVERLAP1>
