       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay, yes, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          i was working on this forever and i was getting all confused so i just had to stop, cuz        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, Wien's Law which is uh what is it like one over lambda-max equals, or actually it's like zero-point-two-nine isn't that what it is? something. do you have your book? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> see i understand the concept, but i don't understand (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <EVENT DUR=":17" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          here's your book, do you want, it?          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah </U2>
          (xx) i'll leave it here        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> see the real reason (xx) they're recording us, sometimes you get a little abusive of the tutors          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh wow </U2>
          (just) smack 'em around if they don't know the answers        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe i should step outside, cuz i don't you know (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you know </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's actually_ they're actually uh very uh, blatantly bugging the office, so          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, okay so, so Wien's Law          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          so,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> the second radiation law's related (xx) so hot stars look blue and cool stars look red, Wien's Law tells us that things like wavelength (xx) s- star </SEG>
          (it says that, three thousand over T of N) so          <SEG TYPE="READING"> what is the wavelength based on radiation? </SEG>
          um,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> for example (Log, Hayes) how do stars create, these two laws (xx) </SEG>
          okay so now um, so what does it ask? what        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay the continuous structure          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          emission (xx) and i was thinking, first i was thinking that (continuous) yes          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          because, (xx) quasar extended,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's easier to do than (xx)          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, and i was also thinking, that, there's a line in the book, that says, (xx) recognize (xx) stars.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but then, it would also apply to, this is where i get confused.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the emission? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah because it seems like it would be all of 'em if it's, continuous (emission spectra)          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i don't think that </OVERLAP1>
          ma- might make sense. okay what causes an emission spectra?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's, the, the spectrum's going through a, fairly dense heat. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so it's going, like, the um... lambda-max that's, the, that's the wavelength of the maximum, on it, that's our radius (xx) T, as far as temperature. so, well let's think though, okay so, what causes absorption again? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we're in a continuous spectrum, and it's going through, some kinda gas i can't remember </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay like, hot dense gas          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or something? </OVERLAP1>
          alright so we actually know these. where are they back here somewhere? radio (xx)          <EVENT DUR=":09 PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          mm, there's something there, light and pulse strokes?          <EVENT DUR=":09 PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          it think it's the, okay blah blah blah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the (original) is emitted by the gas, okay? so, is the absorption, is, emitted, by </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's still emitted by the source,          <OVERLAP1> it's going through </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so you're still seeing the, source </OVERLAP1>
          but the, whatever the um, gas is is taking out a couple lines.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and that's, the, that's how you can tell which, element it is? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because, certain elements will absorb certain, photons          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          or whatever lines (xx)          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's the same for like          <OVERLAP1> emission though </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that's_ </OVERLAP1>
          but for emission you're actually viewing, the um, i think you're actually (given something that comes out)          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) the gas, </U2>
          right so um, i'm, let's, make sure, understand page fifty, let me show you, one-thirty-one, (xx)          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          here's absorption, okay um, these bond (with that)          <SEG TYPE="READING"> (especially with neon sign,) (xx) </SEG>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is where i get confused. </U2>
          so the pinkish-purple, color, (wait, doesn't it question) something about the, mercury vapor (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah that's where i got it from, (xx) they're both emission, lines. (xx) piece, um, for spectrum. um, i was saying, i wanted to say yes,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          because, that would be hotter than,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (right) </U2>
          um, i don't know and, this law with that law (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, um          <SEG TYPE="READING"> by (studying) the spectral lines we can identify the elements </SEG>
          uh-huh-huh-huh-huh, i wanna say that it is all, three of them.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay do these (xx) right here, these two, um,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> emission spectra, solaria, gas will be excited (xx) </SEG>
          so that means it's hot,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but if it's hot, it's not gonna be red, is it?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, it depends how hot it is you know there's like, different degrees of hot (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (you see, i was confused) (xx) (red so then) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so you said_ okay so, the neon tube is red so it's cooler than, the mercury tube, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but there'd still be an emission, line so (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah (it's) just different, degrees of the emission. and so i mean if you're_ okay so if this is emission, and you're saying that even if you can say, that this bright red is cooler than that, and you're using Wien's Law. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can, tell the relative temperature. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> which is (xx) okay. (i wanna deal with that first.) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay... why don't_ lemme just, lemme just consult, Charlie? wanna um okay if you've got,          <SIC> threes </SIC>
          types of absorption you got continuous or, three types of emissions,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> mm </U2>
          spectrum,          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> yeah </U2>
          continuous absorption and emission          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> uhuh </U2>
          and you've got Wien's Law, Wien's Law          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> uhuh </U2>
          does that apply to all of them, or only a, couple of 'em?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> um, Wien's Law only applies to continuous          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (does it?) </U2>
          spectra alright?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, well, that's not no no i'm sorry,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i'm wrong. </OVERLAP1>
          Wien's Law only applies to black bodies, alright?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          lemme, lemme lemme give you this alright? let me say it like this, a black body, ba-          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i had to get up </U2>
          yes that's cool. a black body is is is in a sense a perfect emitter okay? any energy that comes in it absorbs, and any abs- energy absorbs within the mass, so basically, um, the_ i mean it's it's the perfect emitter okay? you can't, you can't get uh, more, you can't get, more protons from anything than a black body at a given, at a given uh, at a given (time) the the, um, so, wha- what happens is, Wien's Law applies to a black body and it describes a black body. now, the thing about, the only bad thing about a black body is there's no such thing physically, you know. however, there are a lot of things that are very very close. um, they yeah it does give off a continuous spectra, however things like um, there's other types of thi- there's uh things you haven't dealt with like (xx)          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> by (xx) </U2>
          yeah          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but, they give off continuous spectra too but it's just not, uh, i- i- it's uh, a different kind, yeah, so uh, Wien's Law applies to a bla- and where's our Wien's Law in here? it's a, sigma-T over four.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) one twenty-six, okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> one twenty-six?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          yeah, so this says, the energy, is equal, the energy given off, is equal, yeah, oh, yeah, okay this is the uh, Wien's Law is the, the maximum this is, they're, they're similar in the sense that this, the energy of (xx) is equal to, the temperature to the fourth power. so that means you increase something in temperature by, two, increase it, two, increase it two times two times two times two. so uh, you can see we're just giving off energy, from uh uh with a black body, in- increased temperature increased energy (xx) that's why (xx) Wien's Law, gives you the, the maximum, the wavelength the, if you look at a s- if you look at spectra, basically what a spectra is, is they say at this wavelength i got, a hundred photons, at this wavelength i got two hundred photons, this is what it's saying right here.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, okay </U2>
          so this is the sh- this is a sh- uh a longer wavelength, so it's saying i have less photons here, than i'm dealing with here. so you know basically, there's a little crou- counter here it's going click, every time a photon (going) click click click click, and right here you're know (you'll) say i'll just say, a hundred thousand photons right here at the, at a blue wavelength which is you know about what is this, four hundred fifty nanometers, and you're getting say, five thousand right here, uh seven hundred nanometers, and that's all a spectrum is. it just gives you, the amount of photons (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it's only uh, continuous.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> hm </U2>
          because uh, Wien's Law, only applies to black body,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          which is continuous.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> right, yeah but, yeah that's that's true but see Wien's Law doesn't apply to all types of continuous spectra. yeah but for (no-) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, but for her, for her purposes, it'd probably be fine. um, let me just see. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but then i don't understand why it couldn't be applied to absorption and emission, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> because, the reason is is because </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's not continu- it's not continual? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> well, what happens is, you know what causes an emission law right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, it's, through gas </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> yeah so you have a a cloud of gas, what happens is there's a star behind this cloud of gas right? lets off radiation, this radiation and what happens in the gas actually, y- you have a little atom, what causes an atom to emit radiation? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it can't absorb it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> it absorbs it first sure, but after that          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          mkay,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          yeah, what happens is um, you know atoms right? you have a, you have a nucleus at the center you have electron          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what happens as a photon comes in, hits the electrons, the electron just basically, it jum- it gets more, energy, okay? and, just because of nature it gets pulled to the small center it just has all this energy, and a little while later you get a few seconds, at the most, it jumps back down (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe you, it doesn't apply to the other ones. cuz you're not getting the entire spectrum.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> well if            <OVERLAP2> thi- if this (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> there's no way that you could, </OVERLAP1>
          determine the max wavelength just cuz you don't have it, it's not complete        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> well y- the thing is is in absorption and emission, is uh, comes in at one wavelength, and that's why. like, like for instance here let me tell you, this is a this is an emission line, this is um absorb- or emission spectrum absorption ste- spectrum. i can't i can't apply this, here because when i, when the, the photon comes out from within the individual atoms, there's no temperature associated with it. there's just it just is, it's pure energy </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> those could just be used to show what element it is? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> right exactly </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's not, for temperature </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> right i mean this, these, you can give off an emission spectrum at, you know two degrees you know uh, twenty-three degrees Fahrenheit or a million degrees Fahrenheit. you can have the same emission. you know          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but it wouldn't be, </U2>
          i mean, well you, yeah i mean you can give 'em off in different temperatures, like at you know, five thousand, degrees Fahrenheit or, a million degrees Fahrenheit,          <OVERLAP1> you can, give give em off </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so, the reason why </OVERLAP1>
          it kinda attracted this one, is because, it has all of the colors, and, whatever, it tends to be, like if it's a higher intensity t could be (considered) higher, so you can kinda tell?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> right but yeah yeah because, the reason is just, when you look at this spectrum, what y- what you're gonna see is thing you're gonna see this curve this is like this is called a black body, it's like you look at the sun this is what it, the spectra looks like, okay? um, but see the emission, emission, uh, emission lines, if you looked at a spectra of just emission lines what you see, is, you'd see something like this          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          straight... and this would be different wavelengths, and that's all you'd see if it was just emission lines, okay.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and, you can't associate a maximum wavelength to it, because, all, all that's all that all an emission line tells you, is, it says hey there's hydrogen, and something's making it, kick out photons.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          all absorption's, spectra tells you is, hey there's hydrogen there blocking, uh, there's a star behind that, cloud of hydrogen, and i can tell because i see these absorption lines.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          do you understand that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... hm, here, okay let me just get this real quick so i can (xx) um, so that means, can't use it to tell the relative temperature, because these are emissions lines,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> mhm </U2>
          and this just shows what kind, of element it is and the temperature of, whatever.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> right </U2>
          alright, okay i got that now so i'll leave that_ oh yeah. this, i don't get this, calculating stuff. i'm not good at calculating anything. i don't (don't even have a calculator.) i forgot about that part          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> mkay </U2>
          (so)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> mkay well, what do i wanna do first? we'll look at this and we say,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> calculate lambda-max for the following stars and estimate which color dominates the visual spectrum </SEG>
          okay, so, what what do we wanna do here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> compute? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> well, wanna calculate the maximum wavelength, at a given temperature, okay and this is, this kind of ties into the last problem now what kinds of spectra do you think these guys give off? in between the (xx) and (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm, okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          we just talked about this today too. i have no idea        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> okay, um, let me ask you this </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if it, well it depends on the lithium string on it right? if you're looking right at it it's gonna be absorption and if you're looking, not directly at it it's gonna be emission? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> not really um, if, if you, lemme lemme put it like this, you have a s- you have the sun, okay?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          or sort some sort of star. and, you uh, you have_ i mean you know how a star works right? fusion on          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (the inside) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay, what you have is uh, you start out, with a star and it starts with you know hydrogen (xx) you know hydrogen helium, and all the sudden starts fusion, fusion i- these different elements you know fuses you hi- put          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          two hydrogens together you get helium you put          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          two heliums together you get carbon          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          two carbons you get oxygen and on and on and on. alright. well you get all these different elements, so, what happened is you just see uh, what you're gonna see, is, you're gonna see, some sort of_ you're gonna see a spectrum, that's, going to be,          <OVERLAP1> associated </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but can, </OVERLAP2>
            can you see them? (can you associate) (xx) because, um, (xx) more elements you can have?          </U2>
          yeah um, o- okay well, alright. let me explain this to you, you know okay you know i i i'm trying to think. i've never i've never been asked a question like this so that's why i'm kinda struggling i'm trying to get through here, um, what happened? let me put it like this, inside a star, at the center is like fifteen million times alright? it's really hot, and uh in that center you know, you know atoms how they each have their electron's outer shell? you know what ionization is?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (when) you're using electrons? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> exactly. exactly so you have a hydrogen atom, if it gets ionized what is the photon comes in, kicks that electron out so hard, it just goes away, it doesn't come back to the, um, so what happens is, you can you can imagine can do that with hydrogen, well you can do that with helium too, all you gotta do is kick out two electrons, and then you go on and on and on, you know you can keep doing any element you want. all you gotta do is basically, kick you know, kick out all the electrons in the, the shell, and absorb it. so, what happens is inside the sun, there really isn't any elements, okay? what this, what you see in there is just, you know a bunch of particles you know, and this is why it kinda causes it, and these particles are very hot cuz of the fusion (xx) and what happens is is uh </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> yeah i got a new one but um, so what happens is, let me put it this way, okay absorption spectra and emission spectra can only happen when you have, atoms around, and whole atoms okay? not,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> not p- (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          continuous spectra happen, when, your temperatures uh, are, very hot, and you have uh, just, you, instead of having atoms you have like electrons and, protons and neutrons all going around the, in general what you have is electrons going around, and these protons are just, the the sh- the nucleus, are just sitting there cuz i mean, electrons are very light you know it's just like, you know the the nucleus is like, a big rock, these, electrons are little ping-pong balls like, no matter how hard those Ping-Pong balls against this big old rock like the rock, it's not gonna move, that's what it's like, okay but these electrons (xx) kick off, they're bouncing around, all this heat's being created, and what's this, what this is giving off, is the continuous spectrum, okay? and then, what happens is you're gonn seeing in a, a spectrum of the sun.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> did we (xx) this is that's, oh you said (xx) is that,          <OVERLAP1> that's probably (data) </OVERLAP1>

          you'll see is, what basically happens in like, (xx) what it is is you get you get some sort of continuum spectra, continuous spectra, and then on top of that you have, like an emission line and maybe an absorption line        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> then you get a fluorescent, (xx)          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="MAC"> a bulb? yeah well you saw </U2>
          (you get the) continuous emission        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> yeah wha- what </OVERLAP1>
          you get is something like this, right? but what you'll get in uh, yeah (in this one) what you'll get is like uh, basically if you look at it like this say this is a continuous spectrum, you'll see like right here this'll be really bright. and this here will be really dark something like this, and that's, that's because of the emission and absorption,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and that's usually due to some cloud or something around it, well, so what, am i_ are you following me here?        </U1>

          you still, like neutron stars (can) only be up to about, three, solar masses?        </U1>

          um, you've got, two millimeter mirror, or two meter mirror          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and you've got, wanna be able to resolve some saying, something that's like, half a meter, or something like          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          yeah say, say          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> alright </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          half a meter.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so, y- you wanna be able to resolve, (it's like what's it,) it's like five meters, and you've got a two meter mirror, (xx) disorganized, so um... so how far above the earth, does the sunlight need to be? so now, you're gonna do, something like this, um, let's see, what are we gonna do? we are going to, let's see, (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it'd probably be in the light chapter </U1>

          excuse me.          <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"></EVENT>          (xx) we don't care about that yet          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          (xx) wait wait wait, what's this all about? (xx)          <PAUSE DUR=":17" ></PAUSE>         <SEG TYPE="READING"> absorbing power in seconds of arc equals (xx) </SEG>
          (not really what we're trying to do) you've got, you've got (xx) triangle, so you've got, some distance D          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and you've got, some, other distance here R... this is your angle theta          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh            <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but it's not </OVERLAP1>
          really like that cuz it's more like, (then again) it is kinda like that. cuz, uh it's like, weird it's like cuz this is bigger, and that's gonna be a lot smaller so it's something weird like this but, um          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          so, let's keep looking          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay, how about notes? has he given you any notes on uh resolution?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, okay (uh let me check?) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DUR=":31" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay (so)          <EVENT DUR=":12" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          (what does that mean resolve (xx)          <EVENT DUR=":16" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) exactly (xx) flip through (this so) i can remember </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          then you've got oh okay... okay, this is what you're_ i think you're gonna do. you're gonna use this resolving power, thing here see it says          <SEG TYPE="READING"> the resolving power alpha in seconds of arc is equal to eleven-point-six divided by the diam- diameter </SEG>
         <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so, you're, given the diameter so you can plug this is this is in terms of centimeters.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay            <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>
          do that          <PAUSE DUR=":21" ></PAUSE>          i'm not sure yeah, so, this is not an important triangle          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          that's okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm usually (passed out at this point) </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":06" WHO="SS" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you're gonna find alpha in terms of arc seconds, okay?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and that's gonna be this angle here, theta...          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and um, then your R here, is gonna equal to be zero-point-five meters... and this is, the distance that you wanna calculate? okay?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so this is like um, this is the satellite, (xx) it's got little, things coming out of it          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          and this is on the earth. so, you want D as the distance okay?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and the way to solve for that, basically so you've got um, you can pretend this is a right triangle, opposite over hypotenuse so it's like, so i don't know if you remember your trig, so, opposite over hypotenuse so that's R over D, is equal to sine, theta, but theta's really small          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so that's approximately equal to just theta?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so in other words, D, equals uh, R over theta, does that make sense? the way i did that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> kind of refreshing (me) yeah </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":15" WHO="SS" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and this is how you're gonna find D.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          keeping this uh you can keep this still in meters, but make sure this is uh i think this is (xx) seconds          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so like, if uh, let's see what we can get, one of them divided by two, hundred, centimeters, um, oh wait we said that, this is equal to theta. like, so (xx) that, so we'll say uh, divide it by (xx) that... i think actually no, i think this has to be in degrees, theta has to be in degrees... radians, no no no, wait, sine (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (doesn't it) have to be in agreement? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do they have to be in radians (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it has to be in_ actually, it's more like a formula, you know um, R equals D, theta, radians? </U1>

          convert this into radians or can use this formula here where um, we say that R is equal to, um, theta, in w- arc seconds, times D divided by two-oh-six-two-six-five, which is the number of, arc seconds in a, in d- in a degree or in three hundred sixty degrees?        </U1>

          (xx) multiply the (xx) by say D, well we_ this is what we're looking for is D          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so um divide this by two-oh-six-two-six-five, yeah, this looks um, does this look right? um, i don't know if this is right.          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>          okay, one divided by this... you multiply that by point-five, yeah you're gonna get like, a lot of meters then, like three (ten to the) sixty meters probably um, so, this, is important information, that should be like, small angle formula (xx) in the book          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>       </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> just to w- well, but i mean it wants to stay in the same place, so what kind of an orbit is that? </U1>

          before we, make any generalizations that may or may not be right. period they don't have a period. orbital          <EVENT DUR=":35" DESC="MUMBLING WHILE READING"></EVENT>          so you know the distance, and you wanna find the period          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          does that look like something you might (xx) does that look like, a bunch of uh... those equations, might be um, important?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um we haven't used this, this equation but we've used these first two </U1>

          then square it? right because square root of the square root so then you've got the four-pi-squared, R-squared times this R then you bring out_ do you want me to show you        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i (know how to do that) yeah okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you got_ i'm just gonna skip the squaring part and just gonna skip the squaring part and (xx) four-pi, uh, R-squared over, P-squared right? bring that R over so now you just (rewrite) this so P is brought over here. this equals, four-pi-R-squared, now times another R, divided by (xx) which is that          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>

          um, and you know the distance right cuz we fig- we would have figured it out (xx) and then using this, you know the masses, map- mass of the earth is like, something times ten-to-the-four, or ten-to-the-twenty-four, it might even be, uh there's probably constants somewhere in here        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, oh yeah, it's in_ it's right on the back cover (xx) right there, (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) that's awful (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> probably like (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mass of the earth, is like, six times ten to the twenty-fourth so just plug that in there you know G          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          does that make sense?          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually that's </U2>
          (important equation) in there, that should work          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          and          <PAUSE DUR=":14" ></PAUSE>          um, so then, you'll find the orbital period and this is how much (xx) watch with one satellite,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then so, this            <OVERLAP2> value then? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> then you </OVERLAP1>
          (just) have to find out you know, whether or not it's moving faster, than twenty-f- i mean is it gonna be (xx) certain point, like cuz a          <OVERLAP1> ge--in a </OVERLAP1>

          right. but um, i think i- depending on what the distance is you can compare with a geosynchronous orbit you can say whether or not it's longer, or um, less,          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> is it, is </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and um you can, so once you find up here </OVERLAP1>
          (you know then) you can find (xx) see how long it takes to go around the earth and you know what the earth's rotation is, so you can make some sort of estimate (or something) (xx)        </U1>
