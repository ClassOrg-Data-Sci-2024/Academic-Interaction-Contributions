       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> this year? this          <OVERLAP1> term? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> this_ </OVERLAP1>
          yes this se- semester right now          <OVERLAP1> i </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          late-dropped because like (xx) i missed a couple of classes my G-S-I instructed me to,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and secondly it's like uh i told you i was transferring to engineering        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> ri- oh but you dropped chem          <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> y- Chem </OVERLAP1>
          one-twenty-five and the thing is when i spoke to the um engineering counselor of the,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the transfer </OVERLAP1>
          and she told me it's like uh my G-P- since my G-P-A was like um two-point-four-five or something and she told me, and uh right now in my engin class i'm doing like an A-minus          <OVERLAP1> Engin one-oh-one, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's good </OVERLAP2>
            yeah.          </U2>
          chemistry i'm doing like a C. and Math one-sixteen like a C-plus.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          mm i could get it up to a B-minus a B, easily like it shouldn't be a problem but still it's like a C in chemistry wouldn't help me much          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and i don't see much hope of getting into engineering.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          and i don't want to waste my time doing it          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i </U2>
          i want to start working on some other major and,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          one major i'm interested in economics but i want to do something else with economics, what do you suggest? math? stats?          <OVERLAP1> what would go well? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no let me_ </OVERLAP2>
            i feel like          </U2>
          a double major?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can do a double major or did you know that you can concentrate in mathematical economics? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> what do you mean by that? no </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean,          <OVERLAP1> that y- </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> is it like a very i mean substantial degree i mean organization- i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think,            <OVERLAP2> everythi- </OVERLAP2>

          it will be_ it's sort of_ it's a management-human-resource          <OVERLAP1> kind of job is that what you wa-? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> i mean are we take_ are we allowed to take uh </OVERLAP1>
          courses from the Business School?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> how many? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well as an L-S-and-A student even if you don't major in L-S_ in in organizational studies you may take up to twelve credits,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> anywhere </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in the </OVERLAP1>
          Business School which is four course_ you know you could take it four_ up to twelve credits in any school outside of          <OVERLAP1> L-S-and-A, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          but if you wanted to do Business School you could take all twelve of your credits,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> uhuh </U2>
          at the Business School          <OVERLAP1> and that's that's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> i've taken like </OVERLAP1>
          engineering already, so          <OVERLAP1> that's one </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and then you </OVERLAP1>
          can take three classes and still get_ you have to have a hundred and eight L-S-and-A credits,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> mhm </U2>
          and a hundred and twenty credits total to graduate so if you wanted to take          <OVERLAP1> more </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> but_ if_ a double </OVERLAP1>
          major would take me like how many years to graduate like um?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, it depends on what you want your double major to be          <OVERLAP1> if you, want to b- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> what do you suggest? i mean i want </OVERLAP1>
          one to be economics for sure i want to do something        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you know you want_ if you wanted to econ- economics, and organizational studies you could certainly do that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> and organizational studies? i could do both?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (i mean,) how many credits are required then? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz how many more credits </OVERLAP1>
          do you have to go?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> i have thirty-one plus like uh i think since i'm dropping this uh eleven (i have) forty-two, right now. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so you are going to need, seventy-eight more credits to go. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> to get an organizational studies and economics? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no to get an L-S-and-A degree          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> to graduate </OVERLAP1>
          from this school, right?          <OVERLAP1> so how you want to fill </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> yeah but what about getting the double </OVERLAP1>
          degree?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you wouldn't be a double-degree cuz both of those majors are in L-S-and-A,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay </U2>
          so you'd have one degree with two areas of          <OVERLAP1> expertise. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> two con- </OVERLAP1>
          two concentrations.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> so it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> how many credits </OVERLAP1>
          are required for that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> a hundred and twenty, same amount          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> same amount? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's just </OVERLAP1>
          gonna depend on how you want to spend your credits.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> alright </U2>
          do you want to spend, your credits doing one concentration in economics and then having more diversity in your other credits? or would you like to spend almost all of the remaining credits in two fields? economics and organizational studies.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> and organizational studies is pretty much um quite diverse subjects right? i mean </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes it's very interdisciplinary um one thing that you should be aware of with organizational studies is that, you can't double-count courses, so for example if you're majoring in economics and organizational studies you could not double-count your economics credits,          <OVERLAP1> for both organizational s- and econ. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> for organizational studies? i mean i'd have to </OVERLAP1>
          take the same class twice if it's required?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you'd have to take a different class.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> a different one okay, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not the same course twice. </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> they would </OVERLAP1>
          make you be more diverse. so that's just something to be aware of          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> i know            <OVERLAP2> the prerequisites for </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but in any event it would be about </OVERLAP1>
          fifty-seven credits total, for the two concentrations and you need you need, sounds like you said you had... forty-two credits?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> yeah </U2>
          at the end of this term?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> mhm </U2>
          so you'd need, how many is that?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> seventy,            <OVERLAP2> yeah i think so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> seventy-eight credits to go </OVERLAP1>
          anyway so you're still going to have a good twenty credits to play around with and i don't know how your distribution looks and that kind of          <OVERLAP1> thing but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> i've finished </OVERLAP1>

          um but the kind of courses that you can take are going to be courses primarily in the social sciences and Toni Morales the organization-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> how many credits are </U1>

          and you might be able to talk_ you know, to ask Toni Morales for example you're gonna have to take statistics for economics          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> (also) </U2>
          if you take statistics for economics you probably won't need to take stateestics statistics for organizational studies.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> but you just told me that you can't double-count them </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but you_ right well she_ i think you just_ you can just_ you have the stats but then you have take like four credits of a different class          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> (instead of) statistics </OVERLAP2>

          and then this is how the rule is gonna go there's a whole bunch of social science departments primarily things like history          <OVERLAP1> political science </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> two-thirty? no no no, </OVERLAP1>
          it was definitely not a hundred-level course, that's for sure          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> if it w- </U2>
          Comparative Politics?        </U1>

          and organizational studies or mathematics or philosophy or anything like that, m- the courses that make up the concentration are three-hundred- and four-hundred-level courses, so you spend your first two years here for the most part taking a lot of one-hundred- two-hundred-level courses exploring your          <OVERLAP1> options </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          figuring out what you like what you don't like, you know you might like mathematics, and chemistry but if, you're_ you know you work your hardest and you get the C-plus and you're just, it's not the s- you know it might be an interest but it's not a strength so you sort of rethink you know so that counts for natural science now you know          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and that's good it all counts, so org studies you have to have, one statistics class and then you have to take courses from four different social science departments and they give you a fairly wide, arrangement. then you have to take...          <EVENT DESC="WRITING"></EVENT>          plus you take courses, from four social science departments.          <OVERLAP1> uh i just  </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> one </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          there's_ they_ there's about eight or nine departments to choose from so you just pick whatever your interests are.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay </U2>
          right? and i'll just write such as anthro poli sci, psych, communication studies, um sociology, i'll put econ last because you'll_ most of your econ i'm sure what will happen with you is you will do your econ for economics and for the org studies you will primarily be taking political science and psychology and things which complement          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> mhm </U2>
          the economics, that          <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> can't i </OVERLAP1>
          like, um take few courses from psychology and few from sociology for this?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that is how that works          <OVERLAP1> yes, yes </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> i can do? like </OVERLAP2>
            mix and match. //            <OVERLAP2> alright. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> correct. </OVERLAP1>
          and the th- the th- un- unifying theme is gonna be that the courses which you would take from sociology and the courses that you would take from psychology, are all gonna be about organ- organizations. how people organize themselves how they work as teams how they don't work as teams, what can go right what can go wrong ho- you know that kind of thing so so thematically it'll be unified but you'll be looking at, business issues and organizations from a variety of disciplines, and so, that's how that works and you may take no more than twelve credits, per department... so you can't for example say that you're doing organizational studies but take twenty credits of psychology.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> alright </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          you're going to do that their position is just major in psychology you're not really doing an interdisciplinary concentration          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          that's how that works. does that make sense?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> yeah it does          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah it's_ there's a flyer in the ha- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what are my other options to take like </OVERLAP1>
          along with organi- (Islamic_) organizational studies? economics and, statistics maybe or (maths) i think um          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it'll take me a lot of time to complete my prerequisites right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> for what for statistics? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well let's look at the prereqs for statistics not very many people major in statistics i don't know those by heart.          <OVERLAP1> i know </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it's interesting that that would be the case. let me just, economics you you need Math one-fifteen which i know you have          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> uhuh </U2>
          and uh Econ one-oh-one and one-oh-two so you're all set to major in economics,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> yeah </U2>
          and then the economics concentration is simply going to be,          <OVERLAP1> you ha- </OVERLAP1>

          and then an additional fifteen credits in upper-level economics.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> mhm </U2>
          and you have this_ you have a book but yours is gonna be blue i think but i gave you one i know do you still have it?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> oh </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> they they they tell you </OVERLAP1>
          you know? you need four-oh-one four-oh-two you need statistics and then you need fifteen additional credits in upper-level economics. including at least six credits that are gonna be really quantitative at least six credits, in Econ four-oh-one or four-oh- you know that have Econ four-oh-one or four-oh-two as a prerequisite so those are going to be more quantitative courses. and all in all that comes out to          <EVENT DESC="CALCULATING ALOUD"></EVENT>          fifteen and twenty-three... comes out to like twenty-six credits, total so that's not          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> that's not a lot </OVERLAP2>

          and so for statistics which not very many folks concentrate in...          <EVENT DESC="FLIPPING THROUGH BULLETIN "></EVENT>          prerequisites went too far... are simply going to be, i've met with people who are concentrating in statistics but they've always been already concentrating in it so i've never really needed to talk to them. you know what this is not terribly difficult.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> thirty credits          <OVERLAP1> (more) </OVERLAP1>

          you know eventually you're gonna run into difficulty because engineering is not going to grant you a degree because they didn't accept you and L-S-and-A will not be able to grant you a degree because you haven't          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> (haven't had enough credits) </OVERLAP2>

          so, that's not a good use of your time. but a lot of students will take like one or two extra courses, that really suit their interests and it's not a really_ very difficult to graduate with say a hundred and twenty-six or a hundred and twenty-eight credits.          <OVERLAP1> you know if you have a hundred and sixty, i would worry </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> yeah absolutely. </OVERLAP1>
          you know you need to be careful you can't for          <OVERLAP1> example </OVERLAP1>

          right okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and you also can't_ and you have to be careful like most departments will say you can take up to so many credits outside of our department, a- la- li- let's see if econ says that.          <EVENT DESC="FLIPPING THROUGH CATALOG"></EVENT>          skipping,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> yeah econ- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> too far </OVERLAP1>
          econ will say, and they do actually say this they don't usually accept transfer credit for four-oh-one. so four-oh-two seems okay but they're saying they don't want.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay here. okay and they they tell you what they want taken on campus. okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> must be taken on Ann Arbor campus other than that i mean is anything else i          <OVERLAP1> could? </OVERLAP1>

          right just so any concentration courses to be taken outside of U_ of Ann Arbor, have to be approved in advance by an economics advisor. okay at least, twelve credits in the concentration plan, have to be taken on the Ann Arbor campus. and they would in- and and so they're_ actually all they're saying is at least twelve credits in the concentration plan including at least three of the credits in upper-level economics elect- economics electives, in courses that have the d- the difficult courses as the          <OVERLAP1> prereqs </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          so you can't go somewhere else and take your quantitative courses. it looks like you can take four-oh-two somewhere else if you talk to them in advance.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> okay </U2>
          um and that's always, just a courtesy. but they have issues about like you cannot take um... right tw- twelve credits you can't say that you're majoring in economics and take all your economics          <OVERLAP1> courses somewhere else. </OVERLAP1>

          math i've always been_ i've always been studying math, so it kinda you know doesn't bother me whether i'm doing it or not,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          i just kinda feel, enh it's just i have to do it it's like        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> what if i, take a history course? how how tough are history courses? two-hundred-level history courses? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well history courses, are gonna be, a different kind of skill right? so if you're gonna do statistics like if you're gonna take Statistics four-twenty-six and Economics four-oh-one and Accounting two-seventy-five you're gonna have tons and tons and tons of problem sets,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> alright </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          so you hafta kinda think in advance,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> uhuh </U2>
          what you're gonna be doing and that's that was really the only reason i said you know maybe rethink the stats          <OVERLAP1> and the, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
            that's true          </U2>
          and the um four-oh-one together. history's gonna be a whole different kind of, work. it's gonna be reading and writing papers. so just as you wouldn't want to take you know two history courses and two political science courses together cuz you would just be exhausted from all the reading you know history might be a good, complement to, um economics and accounting. cuz it's a different          <OVERLAP1> kind of skill </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> i always </OVERLAP1>
          liked this one history course i'm interested in it's two-sixty-six?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          uh Twentieth-Century American Wars?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          uh i guess i could, i don't know do you think it's like a bl- uh is there any prerequisite for that course?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> nope </U2>
          no?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that's the nice thing with the bu- you know you can always look it up, you know so and history doesn't tend to have a lot of prerequisite courses. y- you can pretty much you know there's some          <EVENT DESC="FLIPPING THROUGH BULLETIN"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> mhm i think (it's here) </U2>
          it's two-sixty-six at this point and where'd it go? chka chka chka chk chk right here it just says you know, no prerequisites just you know, it's a humanities. but with history it's kinda weird even when you go to the three-hundred levels they're like do you know how to read? you're interested in reading stuff carefully and writing          <OVERLAP1> a lot in a paper, you know </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN">         <OVERLAP1> but are these history </OVERLAP1>

          just reading i mean i- i've done political science Compar Pol do you think it'd be something like th-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's gonna be like political science. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> reading and writing </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right reading and writing. it's not gonna be like um, the prebusiness courses or the or the pre-engineering courses cuz they're not trying to weed anybody out. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NRN" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="HIN"> i mean,          <OVERLAP1> prerequisites Chem one-thirty Engin  </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          one-oh-one? these courses are they designed to be like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah. </U2>
          the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> absolutely. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> weed-out students or what? </OVERLAP1>
          i mean i keep wondering.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U2>
          why would anybody wanna, go on to          <OVERLAP1> be engineering? </OVERLAP1>

          so there's no sort of weeding agenda but i'll be honest with you people fail these courses if you sign up for this course and you do very very little work, you will do very poorly in the course you know that's_ you need to, you          <OVERLAP1> need to, you know if it's if it's interest- </OVERLAP1>

          i'm kinda comfortable with writing right now. quite comforta- i mean that's the only class i got an A in this semester          <OVERLAP1> (College Writing) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but this, </OVERLAP1>
          you know maybe you should maybe think about_ so organizational studies might be a nice complement for you because it's a lot of social sciences a lot of writing, economics is a social science but it's more quantitative, i mean that could be a good balance i mean i think you should think about,          <OVERLAP1> your strengths and interests </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... so this this is still good then so you basically have, seven credits of natural science seven credits of social science, four credits of humanities and you needed three more credits of humanities as of April of last year, which would be oh it's going this way it's it's fine </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think i got two this summer. </U1>

          so that means i can't count chemistry that's what was happening with the the s-          <OVERLAP1> asterisks. ah </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          a one-credit conversation class or you could take a three-credit Spanish two-seventy?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i was gonna do that but, does that count for anything? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it does not count for distribution Spanish is_ this is how it works and they're gonna make you take all these, speaking classes until you can get to the lit          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay, yeah that's what i thought </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so i guess_ (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          always try to look up Spanish and French under Spanish and French i always have little alphabet          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i never look under romance language a little, spazzing difficulties here um, Spanish Spanish Spanish okay, two-seventy is the intermediate class for non-concentrators but even if you wanted to concentrate in Spanish they are like no no no you have to take two-seventy-five and two-seventy-six, and both of those are excluded, and then and only then are you eligible          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          to take, the literature.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think i'd rather speak anyway.          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> why don't you </OVERLAP1>
          just you only need one credit humanities and you've got three terms to go          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          you know that you cannot take four, biochem classes          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> each term </OVERLAP1>
          so you're always gonna need, something        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. so would that be a total waste to take, two-seventy? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> w- well it depends on </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay i mean i just i want to to keep up my sch- so i know it will be a personal, achievement          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but will it, will that be kinda like throw-away credit or will it count for anything or        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you need a hundred and twenty, credits to graduate anyway and since you're planning on staying the full amount of time even though you already have senior status at the beginning of your junior year,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>

          so how is that, you know i guess you would_ we would only even have to think about it as a throw-away credit if you were in like a mad rush to get out of here          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>

          and you're gonna talk to them about_ and it's just sort of a it's a closure interview.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          okay, either it's gonna be well you've done everything you need to do for the concentration and winter term's a total free term for you usually it's well you're gonna need the following two courses to complete the concentration,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and they check off on you. and then, you meet with a general advisor,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and they check off with you on the distribution, and then you just get a very straightforward letter from the university saying you need two more upper-level chemistry courses and one credit humanities,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and you're free to graduate.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so we're doing it all informally but,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
          just a way of putting everything in writing so that there are no weird last-minute surprises.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright, okay. um, and i have one more question. this summer i took a physics and it          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          went badly.        </U1>

          yeah it was          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it was for the_ yes for the spring. so i'm not          <OVERLAP1> sure </OVERLAP1>

          i bet          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm not sure what i should do about that. if i should take it over? i mean it's it's general physics.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          and i_ the problem was just the time. and, my professor was horrible.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> a lot of it's gonna depend on your purpose of retaking it. if what's happening is_ you, you know you won't need to retake it, for the biochemistry concentration. that's fine it's just it's not a moment of glory but you've done very well in all of your other,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          chemistry and math courses.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          for the med school issue, it might be worth your while to retake it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um i guess i would probably refer you to Carol Brown the pre-med advisor have you ever met with          <OVERLAP1> (her)? </OVERLAP1>

          issues and such um, and i guess it's just not my level of expertise and i'm just looking at your transcript and and the gra- the C-minus is is very flukey i mean there's nothing resembling anything like that anywhere near it. and so i guess if i were you my question to her would be it's just the one grade there are no other Cs there are not even a lot of Bs,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um, is this something which i should be upset enough about that i devote another semester,          <OVERLAP1> to mastering. um </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> to taking it? </OVERLAP2>
            okay.          </U2>
          and the answer might be yes there's some downsides to retaking (a) course just from a purely academic U-of-M perspective. one is because you got a C-minus in the course even though, it is a crappy grade and it doesn't demonstrate mastery with (it) i i don't feel confident that you          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> nailed </OVERLAP1>
          physics,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          looking at that grade and med schools wouldn't either. y- if you retake the class you've already gotten academic credit for it. and a C-minus is considered good enough that you wouldn't get additional honor points for retaking it so all you would really have to show for retaking it is you'd be demonstrating to the medical schools, that once you retook the class you did perfectly well.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> which </OVERLAP1>
          i think might be an important thing to demonstrate to the medical schools but i'm gonna pass the buck and have you        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> email Carol. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so that </OVERLAP1>
          so it wouldn't change my grade point at all is that what you're saying?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it won't change your G-P-A at all.          <OVERLAP1> at all </OVERLAP1>

          reason to retake the course frankly that i can think of is that it would be significant to medical school.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and for that reason i will defer you to the pre-med advisor.        </U1>

          it's about academic language um okay. so you have a D-plus in Math one-oh-five,          <OVERLAP1> right now. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah and i talked to (Clint) </OVERLAP1>
          about it and the way it works out is, um i- the D-plus is the average of my test grades          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          pretty much,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right and then you got your little homework </U2>
          well it just it just worked out that, um like my D-plus_ because, the first test was uh, fifteen          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i think, and the second test was twenty that's thirty-five percent so, um you know the thirty-five percent, gives me the D- gave me a D-plus which means that i'd have to get, like i think a B on the last test to get like C-minus or a C. and i mean i don't know if like, i mean i know i have to make this decision          <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          there's a question of mastery involved here too i mean          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          how confident are you feeling about pre-calc concepts at this point?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this new chapter, like i'm i'm understanding. and the stuff from before i mean i got a C-minus on the last test, but that's you know partly because there's some st- there are a couple things i was fuzzy on,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then, um, like i didn't i just i didn't do like enough of my homework, i guess you know          <OVERLAP1> (for the course.) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you mean you didn't </OVERLAP1>
          turn it in or you didn't finish it?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well he doesn't he doesn't collect it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah you were supposed to keep on it yourself.          <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          yeah so, so like i mean right now i've started you know working with a friend where we do our homework together which, you know          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> which helps </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that way i know </OVERLAP1>
          if i'm doing it right or not. but um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> before the test. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah before the test          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          exactly. but i mean the question is it_ i mean if i get like a B-minus on_ a B-minus or a C-plus on the test, there is a chance that i'd get a C-minus in the class but          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i mean i don't want a D-plus in the class.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't think anybody would want that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i mean is a C-minus equally as bad? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no C-minus is a little better than a D-plus,          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> a little            <OVERLAP2> better </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i think, </OVERLAP1>
          you've got some long-term k- i mean i i'm hearing a couple things one is that i- i- it's_ it took you a while to sort of figure out how to study for this class.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          how to keep on top of it. and and now you kind of, have a handle on that,          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and you understand things that you can do to keep yourself on track.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, and if you have a question or a problem it's so much better to talk to the G-S-I ahead of time and, say i'm not understanding this than to, do it after the test because, you can use the information you get ahead of time          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          to do well on the test. um, but now now you were thinking are you still thinking that you want to go to the Business School though?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean cuz i i think </OVERLAP1>
          you've got you got a couple of different implications neither one of them are particularly easy. okay if you decide that you want to withdraw from this course because you were doing poorly, you would then need to repeat the course.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          which you could do in the winter term. but that would mean that, you wouldn't be able to take calculus until, the summer term or the following fall or something like that and, you're you're probably gonna en- end up having to defer your, admissions to the B-school like you could apply at the same time that everybody else applies but they're not gonna make a decision ont- on you until all of your prerequisites are done.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i see </U2>
          for the most part unless you just if you get a C in everything they'll just reject you outright but, if you haven't finished the prereqs and you've been doing pretty well, they're gonna be like mm gonna see how he_ you know wait and see how he does. um, if you stick with the class and you don't do real well, the B-school_ it's not as though getting one C or a C-minus is gonna totally kill you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          if you're also doing well in your other classes          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well </U2>
          and you do well in other things.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well w- right but w-          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>
          well a- as far as well in other classes like wh- what is the quasi-definition of that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well for the business school th- i- G- G-P-As are usually between like a          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like a three </U2>
          a three-three three-four you know so so a B-plus A-minus        </U1>

          right but that's doing doing w- so what for you is doing well if        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> doing well is like a B B-minus i mean </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the B-school is </OVERLAP1>
          a little more rigorous        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz that'd be that'd be doing well          <OVERLAP1> you know you're you're doing pretty well. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think that would fo- for me that would be </OVERLAP1>
          solid you know          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay solid. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you're doing </OVERLAP1>
          you're solid there's a little bit of grade inflation at U-of-M so most people sorta you know B-minus C-plus is kinda average i don't know what happened but you know C is you know you're like worried i might get a C-minus in this class.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um that's below average whereas you know in the old-world grading scheme that would be just right on average and now it's not you're like ooh. um, but the thing to consider is, dropping Math one-oh-five would mean that you'd need to retake it, the following          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> semester. </OVERLAP1>
          sticking with it and not doing well would mean that you'd have, you know a fairly unimpressive grade on your transcript what other courses are you taking?        </U1>

          drop math would you be able to spend_ do you feel like you're spending so much time on math that it's detracting from your other classes? are you at this point, you know spending so much time on this course that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, if i had done this all along then i'd h- probably answer yes, but, um... i don't i don't know i don't think so.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you feel like if you were to stick with the math and keep trying to work to improve and you have to get at least, you said like a B B-minus on the? B-p- B-minus C-plus on the final in order to? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah most likely a B B-minus really </U1>

          you're working with a friend you're doing homework with your friend        </U1>

          and, i'm not sure the best way to do it like i mean, i'd probably have to like go to that engineering thing that you        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> then because if </OVERLAP1>
          i drop it then i think i'm down to eleven credits then the Business School doesn't like that either. so          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you got it.            <OVERLAP2> and so i guess if you have the </OVERLAP2>

          you got your friends now you know          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and_ to study with and the G-S-I's office hours.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          you know i mean cuz y- it sounds like you've had a good heart-to-heart with with him he's been honest with you what you need,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          you don't need to get a hundred on everything here on out in order to sort of,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh it would definitely          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> finish the class with what_ well yeah but that's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> help but i mean he said that he said that </OVERLAP1>
          it really comes down to the, the final.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i think that's really it. it's just, but um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i don't i mean, i guess my my my i can't make any promises          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i can't promise that you'll do well          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in the </OVERLAP1>
          class if you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> how much </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> stick with it </OVERLAP1>
          but it sounds like you're not so stressed...          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> not yet </OVERLAP2>
           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that that you need to drop it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah no i don't i don't think so. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that you can get_ and i and i think if you get a C in this class it's recoverable if you do well in economics and Math          <OVERLAP1> one-fifteen it's fine. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and as far as </OVERLAP1>
          a C-minus though?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> again if you do well in economics and Math one-fifteen, you know again what they're gonna see there is an issue of adjustment and that might even be something that you'd want to address in your Business School essay.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what did you learn this semester.          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you know?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh quite a bit, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but that_ you know what i'm saying          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i mean a lot of it of course if you get a C-minus in Math one-oh-five and then you get a C in Math one-fifteen and a C in econ the Business School's pretty much a wipeout but          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          i've actually asked the Business School advisor this before cuz students will say they wanna withdraw from a course cuz they're gonna get a C. and the Business School would rather see somebody like struggle with it, get the C, move on with their life, do something interesting and challenging the next semester, than withdraw.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          you know i think if you're failing if you have a thirty-three percent overall and you need to get you know a hundred on the next,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          all the next homeworks they're not even collecting them but the next exam in order to get a C-minus then you're being kind of unrealistic because that's not gonna happen.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but, it seems like the goals that you're setting for yourself in this class seem reasonable.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm... okay </U2>
          and that you, i'm just it's just one of those things          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i can't really i mean          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah i know i i understand. i understand. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if you wanna drop it you can. </OVERLAP1>
          um but it also sounds like this is something that you could probably ride right out,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          if you have the time i mean it's gonna take a commitment from you though i don't think, you can't keep getting D D-plus on the,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          tests...          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          cuz then we know what will happen.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          and then you should probably drop it so if you think you can't do any better than you're doing now        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i mean i think i could do better          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          yeah i th- i don't know.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          let's see i mean i i think i could do better i just need to go back          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it's hard </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and review </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          the stuff from the          <OVERLAP1> first chapter </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but r- </OVERLAP1>
          and also really systematically.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so i don't know if your friend is into reviewing with you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and setting aside time each week but that's actually what they recommend in terms of studying for college is not cramming. but rather doing all the problem sets and reviewing the problem sets. sort of consistently to make sure that you know you're still understanding it let me see if i have my little, study strategies paper. is this it? taking exams that's not it... this is it problem sets yeah. little written on but still good i'll give it to you i'm sure we have others, but they talk about you know studying for mathematics this is written by kind of smart-alecky graduate students. it's got kind of a humorous tone but you know counselors often hear students say well you know i kind of understood the basic concepts but i had a really hard time applying stuff is usually what they say.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (oh yeah) </U2>
          and what they recommend is do all of the assigned problems. not once but three times so they're encouraging you to be obsessive.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh wow. </U2>
          and they tell you how to do it          <OVERLAP1> three times. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> what do you mean </OVERLAP1>
          like all the assigned problems you mean like          <OVERLAP1> all the homeworks? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> all of the </OVERLAP1>
          homework. mhm        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so every time you do homework you should do it three times? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but not necessarily three times in a row. first          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          know first yes you read the chapters in your textbook as they're assigned but don't stop there then you do the problem sets at the end of each section right after you've read it... right? cuz then you know right off the bat that if you can do all the problems, you're confident that you know it.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          if right after you've gotten the reading, you do the problems and you find yourself pulling your hair out, you know at a fairly early point in the term, that all is not well. and at that point to get, you know they say go talk to your friends go talk to your instructor go bother people.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          do it now before you move on to another topic          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and this one just kind of, and that's what's happening with you is you're saying okay i need to go back to the beginning and figure out what topics i've,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i've missed. okay and then they have their little don't worry you know don't don't do it on loose pieces of paper you know set it aside so you can review it. um and then this_ they say this and this is probably something that you should do, with the stuff that you've been doing pretty consistently. cuz i don't think you should try to go back and redo it all at once cuz that's cramming and i don't think people learn real well that way.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right no </U2>
          but if you could do like          <OVERLAP1> a little bit of an old homework assignment? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like at the end of each like at the end of </OVERLAP1>
          each week just do all the homework from the week?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right and since you missed some stuff you might wanna do all the homework from the week but then go back and review,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          something that you didn't understand.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but maybe just one thing that you didn't understand like don't try to do it all, cuz your brain will get fried and you'll get tired and feel all despondent and          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i'll never get it. um and then they do say review it. so af- so when you're not doing your homework set aside time during the week just to kinda review it. just to make sure that you're still understanding what you did and this is_ like i'm not very good at math and (whenever) this would happen to me a fair amount like i would do it i would understand it in a moment, and then two months later i'd          <OVERLAP1> have no idea what i had (in mind.)  </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right yeah, yeah </OVERLAP1>
          i g- i have that          <OVERLAP1> problem. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um so they recommend sort of keeping it fresh in your mind          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so that you don't run into that on the exam where you're just like          <EVENT DESC="GASP"></EVENT>          i forget how to do this i don't even remember what they're asking.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and then they say a week or so before the test and i think you're right because you have left some stuff c- out, um start a systematic review. go through everything. just do proo- and they they they have a little system like don't redo all the homework because that's not necessary but first do a few problems from each chapter some easy some hard and basically you know what you remember you remember what you forget, that's the stuff John that you need to,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          look at. and i don't know if that boils it down but i kinda        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no no that helps yeah that very helps that helps a lot </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like their tone, and i think you should </OVERLAP1>
          if you're gonna stick with the class you should be hounding your G-S-I a fair amount        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh i plan to          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          now i don't have          <OVERLAP1> much of a choice </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> because you know there's there's </OVERLAP1>
          no guarantee of anybody upping your grade,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but certainly if if he sees          <OVERLAP1> you're putting forth a valiant effort </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but if he sees that yeah i mean if i see_ </OVERLAP1>
          if he sees that i'm really trying and that i'm really getting the stuff like i mean          <OVERLAP1> that kinda thing (can raise) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and that you you </OVERLAP1>

          if if he'll get          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, maybe </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a little bit of flexibility if he can tweak you up </OVERLAP1>
          a little bit,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          y- you know he might. they won't ever tweak you down unless you blow off a lot of classes or anything          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but um and he's not obli- he's not obligated to          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right no i i understand that. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> boost you but, </OVERLAP1>
          often with the_ the math G-S-Is will because i mean they know that this stuff does not come easily to everybody.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and it's different to see a student who's a C student        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> now after you take that final exam, and you get the grade back do you_ can y- is there still time to talk to the G-S-I? or no? like i mean like what i'm saying is like you know like let's say, let's say i'm really close. like like i'm talking,          <EVENT DESC="GESTURING"></EVENT>          you know what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> i can't make that for you. </OVERLAP1>
          um, if you do decide to stick with the class i would you know recommend that you do everything that you were talking about doing you know, and just you know keep up with the homework that you're currently at and you know go back          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and do some of the old stuff that you're a little fuzzy on cuz you're, you're still on the_ coasting on the, joys of being here          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, but um and then the other question i had since you uh you were a literature teacher?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          what is the best way to_ cuz like, like at the end of my English class you know he always asks does anybody have any questions on the literature,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and i just look at him like well what do you mean you know i just, like i've always_ how do_ like i always kinda just read to read but how do i get something out of the          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          literature. if you know what i'm saying.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, well i mean there's lots of different things that you can ask questions about. and it's gonna          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> be- </OVERLAP1>
          depend on your, you know you could ask about plot like what did it mean that something happened, do you think? you know what was the author trying to say? often when i'm teaching writing, and i_ if i'm doing um English one-twenty-four which is writing about literature i will ask_ you know the students will really sort of work on you know novels as_ and poetry and essays as arguments you know          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what's_ like give me an example of a book that you read.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um like we're currently reading The Stranger. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. okay so you got Meraud or Mersault or whatever his name is Mersault          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes it's about that. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Mersault right yes </OVERLAP1>
          and he's killed his mother but he seems to be sort of a naive simpleton right? we're supposed to sort of        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yeah          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay so i i've </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> no he didn't </OVERLAP1>
          kill his mother he killed,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> he killed someone, it's been a while. i think i read that when i was in college so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> did he kill his mother? no he killed he killed a_ in the end no he killed an Arab he he killed an Arab and </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay he killed an Arab, mhm </U2>
          because uh, his friend had a problem with him,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          like they got into a fight and this friend, it was his friend's like lover's brother or something and so, he beat up his lover and the brother          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> came </OVERLAP1>
          to kick his friend's ass and        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay, what you might want to do in that book i mean it's written sort of in a stream-of-consciousness style          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so it's          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i think so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> kind of you_ </OVERLAP1>
          we're inside his head.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and i guess you know one question that you might want to ask is you_ i mean there's a whole bunch of questions you can ask i remember the mother for some reason he has like sort of a weird relationship with his mother          <OVERLAP1> maybe? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> maybe </OVERLAP2>
            i don't know          </U2>
          okay um but you know i would just, you know what does it mean that the only point of view of the story that we, we see is Mersault's? like you know can we figure out what else is happening in the book? does the narrator give us any other clues? how do we find out about the murder?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          is he remorseful about this murder?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm not            <OVERLAP2> sure i remember </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if not why? </OVERLAP1>
          what's Camus trying to say? that kinda stuff like i_          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          as a teacher i would always sort of ask, those kinds of questions and i guess you know for something like like um, Camus it's a pretty difficult book you could just ask a plot question i'm just confused about what happened here?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like like i don't know i was just like            <OVERLAP2> (xx) real quick </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a symbolism </OVERLAP1>
          question what do you think you know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know he said like you know like read and take notes but how do you take notes          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          on literature?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, there's a lot of different levels on which you can understand literature right? there's sort of the basic plot,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what happens to who where when why the journalistic kinda you know that's like the main-frame stuff and i think with novels that are written in stream-of-consciousness kind of style sometimes the plot can get kinda, at lost especially if you're, cuz i- if you're listening to the story from a deranged person's perspective which you kinda are.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know? </OVERLAP1>
          um, and then um, then what? um you could also you could ask about character development like you can sorta do a psychological analyses of the characters who are these people? do i like them? are they like me? are they not like me?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um i did a lot of political criticism like i often just was sort of interested in you know how was community defined in books i mean there's lots of different themes thematic things, what is this book saying? C- Camus is just_ it's been so long it's just not one of the ones that i would be, real familiar with but like if it was something like Toni Morrison,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what is the writer saying about this community?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know do the characters come together? do they not come together? you know am i making sense?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah i think so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i'm kinda being vague. </OVERLAP1>
          Camus is not my strong,          <OVERLAP1> point you know </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i know well i mean like </OVERLAP1>

          but you know, are these people waiting for something? they kind of are you got your Christmas you got this very pregnant woman waiting to give birth what are they waiting for? is there a sense of hope here? you know just_ these are just the questions that i'm remembering from the book but_ and and just questions of imagery what's he doing with the idea of pregnancy in this book? what's happening with children? i think there was lot of orphans a lot of          <OVERLAP1> neglected children in the book </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so you pretty much gotta </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well and you can't think of everything i mean          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          i don't think you would be the,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well right            <OVERLAP2> that would be </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it would be </OVERLAP1>
          very impressive but that's one reason why you talk about it with other people is people are gonna have different perceptions?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know? um and with the Grapes of Wrath there's, you know a lot of Christ imagery as well um, and one of the nice things about that book is it's a fair- it's fairly obvious imagery they kinda, hit you over the head with it i remember the turtle crossing the road there          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i haven't you know i haven't read that book since i was like in tenth grade or something          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but that poor little turtle it takes him like ten chapters to you know how is that like the Joads you know that struggle that kind          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          of stuff.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          in Grapes of Wrath it's kinda spelled out in something like Faulkner it might be a little more subtle. but any question that you would feel like asking just you're just kinda like that's a weird thing for the writer to do what's this turtle doing in the book?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          i mean that's that's a question, it doesn't need to be a very sophisticated you know it seems to me that the turtle is representing the Joads' struggle to achieve middle-class stability it doesn't need to be something like that          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          it just can be a question          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> about, </OVERLAP1>
          i noticed the writer keeps referring to the moon,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know what's happening with um... pregnancy or expectancy in Light in August? what are these people waiting for? um, i'm just trying to this is just          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right no yeah i know, i yeah i i understand okay that helps. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> weird random things but just any any question that interests you it's not really about </OVERLAP1>
          there's not like right questions and wrong          <OVERLAP1> questions it's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right no yeah no </OVERLAP1>
          i i know i just          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah but it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it was just the whole idea of like </OVERLAP1>
          questions itself cuz i don't know,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but </U2>
          like i read literature and then you know like we had to write about it,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          for the you know for one of the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> for the test </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> essay topics </OVERLAP1>
          and it was just like, it was kinda jumbled but          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you know i just wanted to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i think that it's good practice to just kinda write questions in a book i always mark my books i mean it's a shame if you plan on selling them back, you know right          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          but i always write in my books and keep them as long as i want, but you just think about the different characters you know if somebody strikes you as weird you know, those are always good starting points you know cuz initially you're saying wow that's weird you know you can't really write a whole essay on on that,          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but then you can begin to_ and you know so you say okay that's weird and then you're like why is that weird?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          (that's) strange then you sorta start doing description and then you're like huh i wonder why the author would do that what's going_ how is this character connected to, and that_ those kinda end up being essay questions often how is this character connected to this event or connected to this character or,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know... i noticed you know every time you know moon imagery appears in this book and you can trace those moments and see if something's happening with the plot you know,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          i don't know,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah no but that but that that's helpful. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you can ev- you can go to his office hours </OVERLAP1>
          as well and just kind of let him know that you're having a hard time asking questions too and,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          certainly do you have an essay due at the end of the class?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, no not really          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> just exams </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the only </OVERLAP1>
          essays we really have are just exams. like we do like some in-class stuff          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but it's really just to see that we're reading.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah and i think if you're feeling as though you know because you haven't had Intro Comp yet, um you really, are feeling anxious about that i would just go talk to him a little bit about you know your concern about the exam cuz you felt kinda at a loss for the last one and,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know you haven't had Intro Comp yet you're a first-semester freshman and let him know that.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          what kinds of tips does he have for keeping your thoughts organized during, you know an hour-and-a-half-long exam or an hour-long exam,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and you know, how does he ask questions when he reads cuz i thin- i suspect he's a fairly different style than me i don't know him well but i'm just i think i'm a little more effusive all over the map than he is like,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          cuz when i teach Intro Comp i'm always just concerned of what questions the students have cuz it's their papers it's their ideas i mean i don't really wanna hear my own thoughts parroted back to me i want you to be able to like tell me what you think          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> damnit kind of thing </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, and why, back it up, um, but you should take Intro Comp next semester.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i know i plan to.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i plan to. okay. yeah so that's all the questions i had really.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and it's a lot of questions and it's good to see you still kinda i mean i think it's it's you've learned a lot this semester i think </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          yeah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and you know it's it's hard work to to do real well here i think... but it's good too because if you can learn this stuff then you can build on it and you know and it would be_ and i've seen people not do so well in pre-calc and then do perfectly well in calc.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          usually for the reasons that you've described though i mean i think if you're afraid of math or you dislike it or you're you know just, not interested not good at it you're not gonna get better but if it was something where you know the first six weeks of the term you're just kinda like hm hm hm hm hm this is fun and then you just kinda realize that you hadn't been doing the work,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and you started doing it and now you're understanding the stuff, there's absolutely no reason why when you go into calculus,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          you wouldn't already be you know doing that work from the very beginning. and subsequently do very well and calculus will grade  the homework the group work at least there's no group work in          <OVERLAP1> calc-in pre-calculus? okay that's good. </OVERLAP1>

          i don't think you need to i mean they'd like you to go to them because, you're signing up for their program they'd like to make sure you're doing okay, um, they have special C-S-P sections basically and they're not really any different_ it's the twelfth.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>

          um but the way the C-S-P sections work is i think math chemistry Spanish but not French or German from what i can gather, and English. there're special C-S-P sections for each        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> the only difference is that C-S-P Math meets one time a week more often, and there's, more emphasis on quizzes and homeworks and sort of testing you on stuff as you're doing it... so that, there's more support there's more academic support cuz you're getting more academic feedback more often, and as a C-S-P student or C-S-P affiliate whether you're actually taking any C-S-P courses or not you can have um free tutoring and so many students join C-S-P for that. because especially if they're pre-med or they're taking          <OVERLAP1> (like history and math) </OVERLAP1>

          there's two different things for creative writing versus English if you wanted to be a professor of creative writing you would after you got your undergraduate degree you could apply for a fine arts degree a Masters of Fine Arts, and you could go study writing and you would specialize probably in poetry or fiction, for two years it's a two-year, graduate degree. and th- U-of-M has one of the best writing programs in the country so, i don't know it could be cool you'd be working with a graduate student if you took this English two twenty-three class but it's a very (you know) prestigious program, it should be pretty good writers, hopefully pretty good teachers too,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um but two-year degree after college (you'd) have a Masters of Fine Arts and that would qualify you to teach creative writing at community colleges and universities, across you know the country, um if you wanted to teach um to be a professor of English, you would have to get a P- and i have a PhD in English actually, you would have to do a PhD in English which is a longer degree that's about a five-year degree,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay so i would go </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> you wanna take math, </OVERLAP1>
          maybe film, maybe a natural science cuz you haven't had any of that here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah... maybe i'll take biology or something. </U1>

         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          so i already took Chemistry one twenty-five and one-thirty like right now          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          what they're asking for, so i'm just wondering like, Orgo, should i, take it this semester and then skip like you know and then go back or should i take it back-to-back? that's what i'm          <OVERLAP1> having trouble with. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you know it's up to you. </OVERLAP1>
          because basically, they're changing um, i can't even talk anymore i'm sorry          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i take English too. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and you have English already oh you're such a good girl. you need the biology,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and that's a_ it's a five-credit class now they've changed the biology curriculum so you can take Biology one sixty-two,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          they've combined the two semesters of biology into one semester so, that could keep you busy. um          <OVERLAP1> and i guess </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> is that is that </OVERLAP1>
          this one right there          <OVERLAP1> one-fifty_ oh okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yep yep now it's </OVERLAP1>
          but now it's this and this is          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> one sixty-two </U2>
          it hasn't_ the course guide doesn't even really r- well the course guide reflects it but not the bulletin.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          um... i mean so i would definitely sort of take this, and then some electives um i guess my question for you is how are you enjoying Chem one-thirty? are you finding it a difficult course?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's fine. i mean it's not          <OVERLAP1> that difficult. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's not a problem? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> nope </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i mean if you want to there's absolutely no reason why not to except          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          that you'd have two labs if you take biology and chem        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it_ i would have          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you know </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> two labs </OVERLAP1>
          anyways if i did it next year cuz i would have physics        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> physics anyway,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right so i guess that that's part of the, i mean i don't see,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> any            <OVERLAP2> problem? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a </OVERLAP1>
          reason not to except if you would find it too difficult.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or like, some people were talking about like, you take the first part of orgo and then during the spring, or summer term          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or whatever </OVERLAP1>
          you take the second part of it,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm you can do that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz it is offered but, </OVERLAP1>
          if i didn't want to take it here if i wanna take it maybe in Dearborn,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> maybe </OVERLAP1>
          Wayne State or something if they offered it,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          is that like a good thing for that, credit to be transferrable here or is that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the nice thing about taking it at Dearborn is your grade would transfer as well.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          if you took it at Wayne you'd just get the credit. um i don't think it matters so much.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it doesn't? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> 'm'm, i mean it's one of_ if it's easier for you, to take it closer to home          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> instead of (coming) here </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          over the summer, i mean that's fine,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          if that's how you wanna spend your spring half-term, that's cool, not a problem.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (if) the spring half-term would that_ i mean i could finish the_ all of, the rest of the          <OVERLAP1> chemistry? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> indeed </OVERLAP1>
          you could you could be, if you keep going at the rate that you were now describing          <EVENT WHO="S6" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you will be done taking, sort of you know the        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or if like if i left chemistry for next year and did physics,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          could i take physics during the, or like could i take          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that would count </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> all the phys- </OVERLAP1>
          physics during sum- spring-summer term? in like Dearborn or something?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you could but you might run the risk of burnout. are you trying to hurry through? i guess i          <OVERLAP1> don't understand what you're </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh no i'm not i'm just wa- </OVERLAP1>
          because i don't wanna take chemistry and physics at the same time cuz        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so what_ maybe what you want to do then is to start chemistry... in the winter,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and then you could finish it up in the spring term and then just take          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          physics,          <OVERLAP1> next year. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> physics during </OVERLAP1>
          next year?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> if that works. i mean you need to be feeling comfortable is the reason you don't wanna take chemistry and physics together that you feel that that would be too demanding for you? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah cuz i'm not good at physics          <OVERLAP1> at all so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay so </OVERLAP1>
          it's physics is the area of concern          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so that </OVERLAP1>
          should be the course that you take without taking the other courses. right          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so your thinking your thinking is very clear,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          that makes sense.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so but like i can take it at a different school like when would i, like apply, to that and stuff? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um usually around March. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> March? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like do i have to apply to the school and stuff like that? i_ over_ </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> usually yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because i i mean i applied before, but do i have to i have to apply again? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's a different kind of application,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          would apply to be a not-for-degree student.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you're basically just dropping through you're just visiting.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> visiting            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> happening </OVERLAP1>
          to take the second half of Organic Chemistry thank you very much.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so what you do is you end up filling out an application to be a guest student.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so you're not really, applying for admission to Wayne State.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          cuz if you were to do that you'd be applying to be, you know an undergraduate you know          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          four-year degree i want my Bachelor of Science at the end of this degree.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          you're just wanting to take the one class and it's it's a pretty straightforward procedure.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or even if i, like at O-U? i mean that's like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> same difference. </U2>
          five minutes away from my house if i took physics there if i finished all my physics stuff,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          would the grade be transferrable here? cuz doesn't          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          like Pharmacy don't they need the d- grade also?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the grade wouldn't transfer here but if you took physics at O-U, you would still have a grade it would just be on a transcript from Oakland University.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right and if you look at who transfers to U-of-M they say like who, certain people completed_ okay forty-three percent of the people who are currently in their program completed their pre-pharmacy work at U-of-M. forty-five percent of_ completed their pre-pharmacy work at another four-year, college or university so it's not like they discriminate against people who take courses outside of U-of-M more people, take courses,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          outside U-of-M than inside U-of-M apparently and twelve percent of these people took all their prerequisites, at a community college.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> community college okay </U2>
          so even then more than more than ten percent of the people they admit, you know went to a community college and saved a bundle.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so i think </OVERLAP1>
          they're looking for a variety of things. um, so you know it's good you're a woman you're a Michigan resident,          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and you're          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so i can really just (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a minority from a </OVERLAP1>
          minority group you know as long as you like nail chem- you know and it's like now you have to, nail chemistry,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um so they don't really care where you nail it,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> as long </OVERLAP1>
          as you're_ you know if you get C-minus in chemistry not that good, um i g- i guess you have some you know, it's up to you i can't tell you whether it's better to take biology and physics together or biology and chemistry together although what i will tell you is physics lab is much shorter.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> physics </OVERLAP1>
          is a two-hour lab.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          so that actually biology and          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> physics </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> physics </OVERLAP1>
          together might be less overwhelming cuz that's only gonna be six hours of lab.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so i could take physics next, term          <OVERLAP1> and then just take chemistry, right. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you could do that and then take chemistry next </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          would work. and physics is also a universal curriculum, it's_ it always comes in as physics, it never comes in as physics departmental credit. it always comes in as either Physics one-twenty-five one-twenty-seven or like one-forty one-forty-one.        </U1>

          so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and um, there is also like, remember i said i was like wasn't sure about computer sci- like i was reading like it's right in there actually          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and it says that like people, considering pharmacy should also consider another thing,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          in case.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. and you'd wanna consider          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> computer science. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> computer science? </OVERLAP1>
          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so like i i don't know what classes i would take for that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i can actually tell you what you should take for that then. although what happens then is you're gonna end up with four really hard-core courses,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (okay) </U2>
          and then i wouldn't take the physics with the biology.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in like </OVERLAP1>
          in the spring-summer can i do that like if i took physics and just like a computer class,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          somewhere else?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you can't take a computer class somewhere else if you're gonna major in computer science because          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          just as i said physics comes in, always comes in as like the right physics,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          computer science always comes in as the wrong computer science          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          when you take it somewhere else,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          i have enough experience seeing p- kids go oh but i thought, okay for computer science what you wanna be aware of, is for example if you want to major in computer science you're going to need mathematics, through Calc Three. so that next semester          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you would need to take Calc Two.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm in Calc Two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> next semester you take          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> Calc Three okay </OVERLAP2>
           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          so i mean that kind of tells you what you would need. um and they tell you the prerequisites so you have_ you'll have at the end of next semester you'll have all the math prerequisites, um and then there's Computer Science one-hundred two-eighty and three-oh-three.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          uh these are the prerequisites. the physics kind of overlaps they want you to have two courses in natural science and, obviously if you're          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i already have that </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> pre-pharmacy </OVERLAP1>
          that will make you do that.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um so i guess my concern would just be if you were to take something like biology physics mathematics and computer science you've got,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if like if i just          <OVERLAP1> went according </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it's very difficult </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          yeah if i we- just went according to this or something          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and like whatever i didn't get into Pharmacy whatever,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          changed my mind went to computer science. would i still have enough time? to finish all that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes.          <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like i'd </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> fr- i mean like the computer science,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          courses        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um you would be starting the computer science courses from zero. y- and you mean your junior year you wouldn't have had any computer sci- you probably would want to take computer science somewhere along the way. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> somewhere along the way okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes, but you would need to_ so you might want to for example, maybe rather than throwing the physics in there now, maybe take biology,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and com- </U2>
          mathematics and          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> computer science </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> computer science </OVERLAP1>
          and then an elective which was a social science or a humanities.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          for balance, do you know what i'm saying?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i understand okay </U1>

          in that class. and i don't know why cuz i i thought i knew it but i don't.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and when you say killing you what do you mean? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like i'm getting like a i think a low C,          <OVERLAP1> or D. </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          um, i would maybe not necessarily want to go on to two-fifteen right off the bat then if you,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          i mean and i guess i would wonder it just_ it would be difficult for y-          <OVERLAP1> these are really difficult courses </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> see i that's what i don't know like if i need two-fifteen like </OVERLAP1>
          later on it just, i'd be forgetting like everything.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i know </U2>

          computer science you will need two-fifteen. the pharmacy and the computer science degrees together are very difficult. what you might want to think about is for example the pharmacy prerequisites happen to be the same prerequisites as biology.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm... so consider something in </U1>

          so it could work.        </U1>
