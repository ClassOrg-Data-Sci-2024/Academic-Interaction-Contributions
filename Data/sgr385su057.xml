       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i don't know i shoulda brought my notebook. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't see Moebius in here... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that the handout? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah this was that co- this was conjugacy so, it might not have anything to do with Moebius. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it must be in Stahl like on around page one-fifty-nine, cuz that's what our exercises are out of. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> does she spell Moebius wrong? she spells it M O B          <OVERLAP1> I U S </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well no she puts </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          M O with the two,          <OVERLAP1> dots above it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> with the two dots just like she does in the book </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think she spells it right </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          let me just point to where (he's) wrong        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's like Moebius. i can't say it like she can. she's like Moebius. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know i have like this other teacher in, four-fifty, and she was_ spelled it like, M O E B I U S. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's how they spell it in the book. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i know. but, in our other class like four-thirty-three, spelled it like, Natasha. so i don't know what's right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> alright so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think, </OVERLAP1>
          O E is a linguistic form it's a vowel, and it goes like /oe/ it goes however she says Moebius, it goes like that, and it's an actual vowel in linguistics and so i think that's why they spell it like that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so what's R-hat? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and          <OVERLAP1> so does the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> R-hat </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          O-dot-dot replace the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that like </U2>
          O-E or something?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> is that like </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i think </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          R minus infinity?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm trying to remember if it's R minus infinity or R, minus          <OVERLAP1> zero or </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> or R </OVERLAP1>
          no maybe it's R          <OVERLAP1> union with infinity </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> plus infinity </OVERLAP1>
          yeah because C-hat is, the complex numbers union infinity.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so that must be what it is. okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> show that, given any three points X Y and Z in R-hat, there is a Moebius transformation which sends the points zero one and infinity to X Y and Z respectively </SEG>
       </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, we wanna find a... Moebius transformation...          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>          zero to, minus one to Y infinity to Z        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so don't we do it like she was doing 'em in class? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> was this on Friday or, when? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i don't know she just seemed to do something like this, one we want to go to Y, and infinity we want to go to Z. so then we have to write 'em, F-of-Z equals equals F-of-X, right isn't that what we do? F-of-X equals and now we want it to be, zero, A plus zero all over, zero,          <OVERLAP1> B plus zero? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so we're n- </OVERLAP1>
          there's no complex numbers in this so that's kinda weird. cuz the Moebius, i thought, okay well Z doesn't have to be a complex number it can be a real number cuz real numbers are complex numbers?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          okay.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          alright.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, F-of-X equals, actually we only need A to be zero right?          <OVERLAP1> doesn't matter </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so you want </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          what everything else is.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you want F of-zero to equal X. is that what we're saying? equal X. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, oops yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. so, it doesn't matter what A is right? and it doesn't matter what C is. it just mat- and D can't equal zero. right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well we have to have, one of 'em be X. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          we want A to be one right? so it'll be          <OVERLAP1> one-X, so we want </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, that's- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          A to equal one, B          <OVERLAP1> to equal zero, C to equal zero and D </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> B to equal zero, C to equal zero, and D </U2>
          to equal one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh but here's, here's what the p- but we're supposed to, we're mapping zero to X so isn't, you stick zero in for Z right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          not X.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          so you wanna make,          <OVERLAP1> you wanna make </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you wanna make </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          B X. you know what i'm saying?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, say a function of a number, like F-of-zero, equals, like F-of-X equals zero, and then F-of-zero equals what? zero because you're sticking, that number, in the parentheses,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you see what i'm            <OVERLAP2> saying? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> into </OVERLAP1>
          the term.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well she did like F-of-Z equals A-Z plus B, right? so you whatever you stick in for Z on the left you gotta stick in for Z on the right so if we put zero          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          if we do F-of-zero, then you wanna put A times zero, that's all        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you want A to be zero.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. </U2>
          no you don't care what A is do you.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, did we, okay did we determine that Moebius maps were like isometries or whatever? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so can we, can we do- can we do a reverse mapping can we map X to zero Y to one and Z to infinity? and then, will that give it to us? if we have a map that does that,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> then we            <OVERLAP2> just use the inverse map? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> then there'll be an </OVERLAP1>
          inverse map right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we could if it would make you happy. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well because it's a, isn't it hard to map, like how are we gonna map zero to X. you know what i'm saying? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i'm, kinda confused about what she wants. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz if y-... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this woman makes me crazy. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz you're right. it's the case where like, where A equals one... B and C equal zero... and D equals one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but doesn't that map it to Z? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no cuz we're not </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> A-Z plus B so that's one times Z plus zero, all over, zero times Z plus one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but our Z in this_ Z is just whatever, number you stick in.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <EVENT DESC="SNEEZE"></EVENT>            excuse me          </U2>
          like X or Y          <OVERLAP1> or Z or zero </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so now Z </OVERLAP1>
          is zero?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> wait a min- well. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and what is X how do you get the X out? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah see that's what i'm saying. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DESC="SNEEZE"></EVENT>          excuse me.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> bless you. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's why i'm saying maybe we need to go from F-of-X to zero. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright let's try it. so let, F-of-X equal zero. so that's gonna be          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          that only gives you, basically A and B.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> D has to be a number. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well that's good we want some of 'em to be, we don't want it to be fixed by the one point we want it because we need to stick in stuff for the other points. we need to combine it so that one mapping maps, three different things, you know what i'm saying? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so alright if you wanted to make F-of-X equal zero </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so we're only doing one Moebius transformation for all of these? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well but we decided that A and C can equal whatever. oh that's important. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that was in the first one but in the second one i have A plus B equal to,          <OVERLAP1> Y </OVERLAP1>

          and A plus C equal to one. C plus D i mean, equal to one.        </U1>

          cuz the top has to, like the sum of the top either, i mean A could be easier or        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> what if- what if A plus B, equals two times Y and C plus D equals two?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          it just has to be proportional so you can't break it up... but if we have A and C being whatever, then let's make them something that works.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's... like what if you made, A equal Z and C equal one or something. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but they can't equal whatever because in the bottom A over C has to equal Z. </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you make </OVERLAP1>
          it so that it works.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you want A to be equal to Z, and C to be equal to one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, so what if we do that...? well no then that gives us uh, Z in the Y equation. unless B equals like Y minus Z or something well it could be done... it's gonna get complicated though... so if A equals Z, </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and C equals one... then you've got, Z equals B over </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but R-hat must be out_ the line, because the, it says it calls the points zero one and infinity, right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so they're not coordinates          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you're right it doesn't </U2>
          so it's gotta be the real number line plus infinity, plus a point of infinity        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yeah i like that. yeah because the I part has to be zero so it just has to be just A. okay. so if it fixes zero one and infinity it fixes R-hat... any Moebius... transformation... so can't we say it has to be, like a f- what we need to say is if we pick a point X, on this line, then it's a certain distance from A, from zero, and a certain distance from one, and </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and a certain distance from infinity </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> certain distance from the point at infinity. because          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you can't </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we're talking </OVERLAP1>
          R-hat it includes infinity as a point.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but you can't necessarily measure a distance just cuz it's a point right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's an infinite, distance... alright.          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>          but we can use the first half of the argument.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and </U2>
          and it has to do with which side of the number line infinity goes to.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          does infinity go to infinity or negative infinity?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. so let's think. i mean if it's outside, of the interval between zero and one, then it doesn't matter which side of the line it goes to because you're a certain distance from zero and a certain distance from one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you're mapping infinity to A over C anyways right...? so you're mapping it to a real number. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you're mapping it to Z. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> d- i'm just thinking about part, even part A or any of this, how can you find a M- Moebius transformation that maps uh, infinity to a number, and still preserves distance. maybe it's not an isometry. oh yeah it is. the Moebius group is the isometry group of H-two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well we're not in H-two we're in R-hat.          <PAUSE DUR=":09" ></PAUSE>          besides that you could always say this is Z way out here at negative infinity... it's weird when she talks about infinity just like it's a regular point.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> F-of-infinity equals infinity? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah... alright so we have, i mean if X i- is not between zero and one, if we're fixing it now, for the hint, then it doesn't matter, where infinity is. so the only time it matters where infinity is is if it's between zero and one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it still matters. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> why? in fact, the only place i think it matters is when it's on a half... cuz only then is it the exact same distance from zero and one... otherwise you could be, like one like three units from zero and two units from one, that tells you where X has to be and what side of the line it has to be on.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and, the other way around so i think the only place it matters for infinity is, is if you're right smack between zero and one...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so let's say that uh          <PAUSE DUR=":12" ></PAUSE>          so let's say        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":18" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so if X isn't at a half then it doesn't matter where it is. </U1>

       <PAUSE DUR=":40" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then to find out where it is from infinity we just need to see if X minus infinity is greater than zero or less than zero... </U1>

          like, you know how we had F-of- zero equals X? we didn't. we thought... we had something, i don't know. i don't think i used it. i don't know but, it had F-of-one equals Y so, A plus B equals Y, and C plus D has to be equal to one, right? to get Y.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so you took out the multiples. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so because, s- when alpha is one, and C is just some number, you can't really determine, what D is, because, C and D have_ the sum of the two has to equal one and the sum of the tops need to equal Y. beca- because if A is two-Y and B is, three-Y you'll get something ridic- a just a multiple, so. </U1>

          but the only place, that it's not like that is right in between zero and one if you put X there then it's the same distance from zero as it is from one, that's why you have to know where infinity is. so if X minus infinity, is less than zero        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't_ i still don't think that matters. i don't think the middle point even matters. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but you have to know where it is. you have to show that it fixes R-hat. and you can't fix R-hat unless you can determine exactly where it it is. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well yeah but </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          w- if we're using the argument that it has to, retain the distance,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          if it's, a distance X from her- if it's a distance Y from here and a distance Y from here and if you fix those, it can't be anywhere else but a distance Y from both of those. if it's a distance Y from this it's a distance like three-Y from that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so you're saying that it doesn't matter because, if these are fixed </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's gonna have to come in between so that the distance works... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well just if they were swapped like if this was one,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and this was zero then it would still be the same distance.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right eh but it's not you don't have to_ it doesn't matter what what happens with infinity if infinity gets mapped over here that still doesn't matter does it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well then it's not the same. what if it has like this and infinity is over here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but we're s- we're arguing that that map can't happen. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah and that's because infinity is, on the right so, if X minus infinity, is less than zero... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if X minus infinity </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is less than zero then infinity has to be on the right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no X minus infinity, is gonna be negative infinity. right? always,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          it's always gonna be less than zero.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no because if you put infinity over here, then it's gonna be, bigger than zero... that's the idea. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, but infinity's over here to start with          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah but if you move it </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so oh </OVERLAP1>
          you're subtracting X minus F-of-infinity, not X minus infinity.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          oh okay. alright.        </U1>

          just happens that A is zero          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          alright alright        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. so if A equals zero then you get, K-squared over Z-bar. </U1>

          so you see example nine-point-ten, the first expression they have,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> two-squared </OVERLAP1>
          over Z-bar? that. so I equals zero plus one over I. so K-squared... K equals three... K-squared is nine, over, minus-I... ta da ta da ta ta          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          and now we're doing        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or if t- i mean if you get a ticket later on and they'll pull you over and they'll be like oh, you have an outstanding you know but if it's like one outstanding parking ticket and you'll be like oh i didn't even know. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh i see. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know. it's like oh i forgot. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> reflections in the bowed geodesic have the form </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh once i got two parking tickets in one day. it was like a couple years ago but i was so mad. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so let's- let's just like take a guess. let's say we're gonna take </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know i think we can't_ reflection over a vertical line. so let's do one of those. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah we're gonna have to do one </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's do that first. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. let's do it first. okay? let's          <OVERLAP1> make </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          no. let's do it let me think. yeah let's do it first...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> they did it second, but. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well let me see. if we look          <OVERLAP1> at this one </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz all </OVERLAP1>
          you wanna do is just add on, you know maybe we're just adding on a constant term. so what if we say that Z, over two-Z plus three,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's do it second. </U2>
          equals like,          <OVERLAP1> no let's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> let's do it </OVERLAP1>
          second.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright alright. okay          <OVERLAP1> so what do you wanna do now? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> let's do the regular kind first. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. i will make myself clear. let's do, the kind that we, let's do the kind over a vertical line first. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then followed by inversion.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. </U2>
          okay. so it'll be inversion zero something, composed with, reflection...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> reflection, across any vertical line we want          <OVERLAP1> so let's do </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> composed with </OVERLAP1>
          negative-Z-bar plus, whatever.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's do reflection across, three. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but do you know how that, how does whe- what it's across affect the equation? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it's going to </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like how does the negative-one apply and, relate? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know          <OVERLAP1> how but one. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> just ig- </OVERLAP1>
          just ignore whe- what it's over that doesn't matter. you know? just p-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you have to know what it's across. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no you don't look get rid of- this is the equation negative-Z-bar minus two just take a negative-Z-bar plus some number.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. </U2>
          it doesn't matter what it's over... but we know that's, that's reflection over some vertical line.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> reflection across... reflection across, let's do reflection across but a reflection across, a, vertical line, not located on the Z-axis, it's the same so if if it's, reflection across the Z-axis then we have one over Z-bar right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          no. then we have negative-Z-bar? or one over Z-bar.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know what's cool about what they have is they have like </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> negative-Z-bar. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, if we wanna reflect across like, three, then it'll be like negative-Z-bar plus three or negative-Z-bar minus three. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay all i'm saying is that's not what they did. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't think it is either. but          <OVERLAP1> i think we have to try to find the formula. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> all i'm saying is i know it's not what they did. </OVERLAP1>
          just, for, just for now,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do it like that? </U2>
          ign- ignore, we can figure out later if we want to, what it reflects over, but now just do this because this is the only thing that matters when you're doing the formula, is uh, is this thing. this w- you could care less, what that is.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so let's do </U2>
          cuz you don't even use that in the formula you use this.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> three. let's do negative-Z-bar          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> plus three? </U2>
          minus          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> minus three </U2>
          minus three.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so let's do minus three. cuz that they ended up with positive numbers so let's do that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. that's what we're doing.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          so now F-of-Z is negative-Z-bar minus three and now we invert over it, with a radius of, square root of two...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, I-zero, square root of two. negative-Z minus three. so what does that equal? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that equals two? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> over </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> minus oh wait. over, what are we doing on the bottom again? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> Z-bar, so it'll be </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh we take the bar of that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so we're just gonna </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so it'll be, </OVERLAP1>
          negative-Z,          <OVERLAP1> minus three, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> minus three </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and now we have to, that's all. so see, we're only getting one Z, and we need two Zs. two Zs. oh so let's do the other one first.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          i concede to you.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the inversion first,          <OVERLAP1> and then? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> let's do </OVERLAP1>
          the inversion first.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          so th- yeah. inversion over square root of two is gonna be, two over, Z-bar. four. no two over Z-bar.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> use_ how about we do like, okay so you wanna do square root of two? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. i'm trying to get two-Z to come out. that's what i'm working on. cuz we have to get two-Z, to come out and be on the bottom. that's why i think you can't, have, it have to be over, the origin. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah she may have messed up when she said that cuz they didn't. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah and how else would they get something with two Zs in it and we didn't? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well they even, they even said </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe she meant the X </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> lookit their inversion is centered at negative-four zero. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah          <OVERLAP1> let's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think she- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so let's </OVERLAP1>
          center it wherever we want.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> do what we want. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think she meant the X-axis... like centered in on the X-axis.          <OVERLAP1> but because </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i think she did too. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          okay. yeah. that's fine. alright.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so... we have... do you wanna do it the same way they did? invert first? let's invert </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah let's          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> over </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
          we we want Z on top of Z. so w- what they did was they did an inversion first.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah so let's do, inversion </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how about centered at          <OVERLAP1> like negative-two zero. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that should work. </OVERLAP1>
          that should work.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i wanted negative-three zero. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay let's do negative-three zero. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> R, Z, minus          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>

          let's try that and see if it works. but see they got, a five, and that didn't give them two-Z.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well we're just playing around let's see what numbers we get and then you change the numbers that was the whole point. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that's gonna give us... </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or did we say square root o- </OVERLAP1>
          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that gives you two, right? over... </U1>

       </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we have a </OVERLAP1>
          Z-bar on the bottom but we don't have anything on the top, so let's find out what kind of,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> alright? </OVERLAP1>
          let's find out what we get on top. so this is gonna equal, minus-three-Z-bar, plus nine? no.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> plus eleven? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> plus eleven? no no no. cuz it's minus-nine plus two so minus-seven? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but now see that gave us, a negative-three-Z-bar. and that's really not kind of what we wanted. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it's not what we wanted. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but let's keep going. followed by the reflection Z-bar, minus Z-bar, minus, what point do you wanna put in there...? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know... so how are we gonna get a two-Z on the bottom? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is looking, is this gonna be maybe two inversions? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i thought about that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know it's gonna have to be because you got Z-bar and then you gotta get Z back. right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we wanna end up with Zs not Z-bars. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but they did. they ended up with Zs. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but, um if you reflect, it doesn't matter. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah cuz they did oh yeah cuz you s- when you reflect you take the bar anyways. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          so do we wanna reflect now and see what we get?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> if you reflect it doesn't it doesn't change the numbers in front of your Zs. see what i'm saying?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> why not? </U2>
          so we either because all you do is, you,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah but </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> bar </OVERLAP1>
          it, and then you subtract some number that doesn't have anything to do with Z, you subtract a constant,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> alright, so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or you add a </OVERLAP1>
          constant, so our either our inversion has to get it, right the first time        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so let's let our inversion be, over negative-two comma zero </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> are you able to even get like, Z over, like a, some kind of number? this is what i get, something like this,          <OVERLAP1> i did </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it </OVERLAP1>
          doesn't matter what real number we put in there. i think it doesn't matter so let's do        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how does it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it will it's gonna change what your, it's gonna change what your constant is up on top but </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but if it doesn't, cha- it doesn't matter what the constant is          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          then, when we do the reflection over a vertical line we can do it over any vertical line we want. so no matter what we have going in there we can fix it.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          so let's do inversion, over, two        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> how do you change what you get in front of the Z on the bottom...? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's invert twice... because we want to flip it over. so we wanna get what we have and then          <OVERLAP1> flip it over again </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think we wanna </OVERLAP1>
          invert twice.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i agree. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. let's try it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so let's invert over negative-two zero first. and then let's invert, over the origin. that's what i think so what radius do you want? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> invert over what first? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> invert over,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> some </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> negative-two </OVERLAP1>
          comma zero.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> let's do what they did. let's do the square-root-of-five. cuz like what if- what if you get what they do, and then you like, invert it over the origin or something. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i think we wanna do the origin next. don't we wanna use one of the numbers          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> cuz what if what if you </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that (they're) talking about </OVERLAP1>
          but they got a five who knows where they got their five          <EVENT DESC="GASP"></EVENT>          five is three plus two.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> questionable. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but why don't we just          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          it's just about the same. so let's invert over, one. radius one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'm just going to use general Ks As and all this other jazz. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <OVERLAP1> i'm using, inversion </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> alright so you're gonna use negative-two zero? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and radius one.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> alright </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's what i'm </OVERLAP1>
          using. and that'll equal one, over... Z-bar, plus two, minus two.        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":15" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so minus-two-Z-bar minus three? over Z-bar plus two? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you are a lot faster than me... yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then... we really wanted a plus three.          <OVERLAP1> but but it might fix- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no. no we got </OVERLAP1>
          a negative-two-Z-bar minus three right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          that's, negative-two-Z-bar plus three.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so let's keep it that way over Z-bar plus two, and now, let's invert again          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and this time we want it over the origin... and now          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we shou- </U2>
          we need to choose a radius.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think we should, keep radius one or something. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> keep radius one again? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          or whatever i don't- pick whatever you want.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well let's keep radius one. so this'll be... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you got a one on top          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          and then on the bottom you get the bar of what's already there.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that's, negative-two-Z minus three, all over Z plus two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so Z plus two goes on top. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and there's a plus two, after that? no there's not? that's all.          <PAUSE DUR=":15" ></PAUSE>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that gives you negative-two-Z-bar minus three? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah... i don't like that. i can do it with three reflections i think. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that's Z plus two, over negative,          <OVERLAP1> -two-Z plus three. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> because, </OVERLAP1>
          we're really close.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah we are close. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's two reflections. i mean if we did one more reflection then we would get it. because we would do a reflection over a vertical line.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          and then that would make, uh no it wouldn't. that wouldn't work either.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no you you wanna you gotta stick with two because you gotta get the Zs back. you gotta get Z-bars and you gotta get Zs. we're close maybe we just gotta, change something just a little. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so instead of doing this second inversion </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so what the thing we need to change is the, center of the in- circle of inversion. right?          <OVERLAP1> so we got a two-Z plus three </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but that's gonna multiply, </OVERLAP1>
          that's gonna multiply the first Z. let's try, doing it over a vertical line now. stay where we were with the first one cuz i think that's cool. and then change, do the second one, like this.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          i don't think it's gonna work do you? you don't do you?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know i don't think_ i i stopped thinking that guess-and-check's gonna work. i thought i'd be- i thought we'd be able to see pretty clearly what the numbers were how they were being affected          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          i don't see that.          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          we could work on four and, i don't know.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so which ones have we left so far we've left </U1>
