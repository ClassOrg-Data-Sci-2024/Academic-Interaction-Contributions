         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
          the the additional scirpus.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          cuz we do have more growth here,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but the major part for you today will be completing the, the the circumstances relating to the weather.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> right.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          um, is it is it, the water was twenty-two and the air was twenty-one is that possible?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> s- oh absolutely. um at the moment the, oh absolutely the air temperature is is is gonna be lower than the water temperature. because of the thermal capacity of water, it's a terrific buffer.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so as you get into the fall there'll be_ the water temperature will lag behind the air temperature, and then in the spring the water temperature, sorry the air temperature, the air temperature will be lower and the water temperature will be warmer in the spring it'll be the other way round.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          uh the, temperature of the water will take a long time to get up to the air temperature.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          temperature peaks about August. late Ju- July August.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and the the does it like depth um, in terms of,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes? </U2>
          does it, matter should i,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U2>
          (estimate?)        </U1>

          would've been a good idea to have brought          <OVERLAP1> a meter rule, </OVERLAP1>
