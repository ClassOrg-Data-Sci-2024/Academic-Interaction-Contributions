Dominick's is the largest hub of underage drinking, ever to be imagined on University of Michigan campus. basically what happens there is that you get into a line, somebody with an I-D goes up there, orders, big pitcher of sangria, everybody's, maybe familiar with sangria maybe not probably shouldn't be, anyway, everybody knows what sangria is you go up to sangria guy, i want a pitcher of sangria. so he hands you one glass, and a pitcher of sangria. now, is one person really gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria? no. so that's why that person brings the entire pitcher and one glass back to the table where there's twelve friends who all can't, get in and shouldn't be there in the first place, are all gonna suck down this big pitcher of sangria. if you want more I-D_ you_ you want more glasses you're supposed to have more I-Ds. but, i've seen people drink straight out of the pitcher and i don't understand what the mentality is because honest to God like if you_ one person is gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria now sangria's pretty dilute. but if you're gonna drink an entire pitcher of sangria i'm sorry you're not walking out of the joint so i don't understand          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          how they can just let you get away with that. but anyway.

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so here's the story about this building, as s- so many people are so impatient to hear about. this building is the Law Library. it was built in the mid-eighteen-hundreds by a name, by a name. by a man by the name of William Cook. William Cook was an incredibly rich law professor that went to the University of Michigan and taught here, and he decided hey let's just donate about oh i don't know about twenty million dollars that i had back in the mid-eighteen-hundreds which is a fat check, still now but was a fat- even fatter check back then, to the University of Michigan to build this law school he wanted to build it after the Stanford_ er this the_ the Yales the Harvards you know the really nice Ivy League posh places right and you can see, i mean it must've cost a lot cuz all those things are hand carved up there you get the shield right there the crest and you got all these little pillars that are hand carved blah blah blah, and he said two things have to happen before i... are gonna_ am gonna give you all this money. one, the whole building the whole thing's gotta be done by the time i die. secondly if you're gonna add on to any part of this, then you have to guarantee that it has to be done in the same style with the same brick. as, it was done now. so they're like okay. well that's cool. so they worked their butts off to get it done before he died and he was really old but unfortunately he died just before they finished it, sucks really bad about two years boom he's dead, they hadn't finished it yet, and the second thing is when the University of Michigan decided to add t- on to it in the nineteen sixties, they didn't have enough money, to add on to it because the price of brick went from about six dollars a brick to sixty dollars a brick so they couldn't afford to do it so what'd they do? dug a big hole in the ground didn't use any bricks and went underground. this is what you're leaning over right now. into the Law Library which is down and to your left you can see (xx) but, that's basically what it is. you cannot get i- get down there unless you are a law student, you can go down the stairs and you can stand there and they'll swipe your card and if it doesn't say you're a law student,          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          denied you have to go home. but you can sneak into the Law Library if the person doesn't happen to be there which i definitely recommend to all undergrads while you're here. also another thing is you get up into the Law School and you climb up on those balconies like that where those other windows are. course that's also not an official, university position that i'm taking, but it's fun as hell. do this          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          especially really late at night, so, definitely take advantage of sneaking into the Library they've got really neat, uh classrooms in there that are actually mock courtrooms. so it looks looks just like L-A Law you guys remember L-A Law? (xx) pretty cool in there so i (mean) computers and stuff it's fresh as hell          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>

          another neat thing about the Michigan Union is that_ well not a neat thing, a kind of a stinky thing, was that it was originally built only for men, when it was first built. um as you can see, the two ideal Michigan, men_ male students, are exemplified by the two statues that you can barely see, underneath the ivy the one on the left is the athlete and the one on the right is the scholar, curious that the scholar's completely covered, and that the athlete is not hm. anyway what happens at the Michigan Union in the bottom basement of the Michigan Union there's the MUG the Michigan Union Grill great place to hang out especially when, Michigan's playing games and stuff like that um major games everybody's piling in there eating food that's down there there's a lot of fast food down there, also the Michigan Union Bookstore is down there Mail Boxes Etc there's a travel agent, the computer showcase that you're gonna talk about tomorrow that's down there on the second floor there is a billiards room pretty cool to hang out there until two o'clock in the morning shoot some pool, and there are a lot of secret societies that have their, meetings up there and a lot of other organizations and groups and major university administrative-type people, that hold their offices there as well. we're not gonna go in the building because, most of you've probably been in there if you haven't i definitely suggest that you go in it, but for the sake of time and to make sure that we do get to go off campus we're not gonna go in it i'm sorry. any questions? come on you guys... alright          <EVENT DESC="STARTS WALKING"></EVENT>          okay so since you guys are my pace cars now cuz you were in back and now you're in front, we gotta kick up the pace. gotta kick up the pace. you're concerned about the rain aren't you?        </U1>

       <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so alright anyway. so okay there's a lot of different things to talk about in this area. introduce you to a few buildings on campus so i don't_ i give you the full tour. over here is the, Randall Laboratory Physics Building this red one right here if you can_ you can barely sorta see it over here, is the middle white part in the middle now why is this building cool? well physics is held there and physics is cool. no actually physics sucks i hate physics it's probably one of the worst subjects that's ever been taught here ever, um that's just my personal opinion, but um anyway the cool b- part about this building is that middle part is all completely free-standing and it's on its own base. it's on its own base. why is it on its own base it's so it's they can do seismic studies. they have these little generators in the inside that can shake that part of the building so they can do, earthquake stuff. pretty damn cool okay. the rest of the building, isn't like that but the middle part it's all labs up in there and it shakes freely on its own base. whoa. moving on to the left coming over here to the brick building over there is the School of Natural Resources and the Environment anybody involved in that? really cool program here at the University of Michigan lotta people call 'em tree-huggers, i do too, but i got a lot of friends who are in 'em_ in it so i can do that. really really really neat if you're, going into biology another neat thing to do is to go to the Biological Station up, towards the U-P. really really cool thing to do i did it i studied insects, and uh ecology. the insects was a little off but it was pretty cool too cuz i got the really phat Belostomatid it's really really neat it's kinda          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          crawling around it was huge killed it big thing          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          it was really fun, talk about that later too Chemistry Building's right next to that if you're interested in chemistry or even if you're not that's the Chemistry Building, one of the biggest lecture halls, in the world is in that building right there actually just in the United States. uh holds about six hundred people but they can't even put six hundred people in there because it's not built um right the N-E-A the National Education Association or somebody else said, sorry you can't fill it to capacity, because it's kinda like, it's kinda drawn          <EVENT DESC="DRAWING"></EVENT>          like you got the, chalkboard here right, and you got all the seats that go like this, right, and the problem is you can't put anybody here or here, up in this area sorry or up in this area because they can't see the board right. so, they actually can only put people in this middle area, so they can only fill it enough so that people can sit in the middle area people sit on the sides anyway and sleep, but you know you gotta give it an (opportunity.) another neat thing about this b- room is that right here where these, chalkboards are three chalkboards lift hydraulically up into the air about thirty feet in the air. pretty cool they write on the one board write on the one board write on the one board, they don't feel like erasing it. and here at the University of Michigan, you can be lazy as a professor and hit that, little key          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          lifts it up to the second level. you get bored you're writing on the board writing on the board you don't want to erase that one either.          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          you can go into three tiers up in the air and you got this huge phat chalkboard thing, up in the air. pretty cool so if you e- ever have a class in there go in there cuz it's cool. it's intimidating as hell but it's really cool. just to realize that building that room we were in this morning, that's just like all the_ a lot of all the_ uh blah la la la. that's just like most of the um, lecture halls on campus. the one we were in this morning, that's pretty standard. don't flip out it's not that big. that one, is huge it's the first lecture hall i ever went in and the first one i ever saw i walked in, registered for classes i'm all geeked i went in for my, my uh, my first class my chem one-thirty class i sat down, four hundred other people around me, pissed myself i was so scared.          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but, keep in mind that Angell Hall Auditorium A is the average size classroom that we were in this morning. moving around the corner, we have, with this white little, um Hershey's-Kiss-looking thing, that is a greenery, green_ what is        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> greenhouse? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> greenhouse. greenhouse thank you very much yes i am a biology major. uh the building behind there is the Biology Building, not much in there except the Nat Sci Auditorium, cool stuff happens in Nat Sci Auditorium they show free movies in there every now and then, you gotta wait for about two hours in line just to see the free movie but it's pretty cool nonetheless, and uh you'll take exams in there it's one of the worst places to take exams because you're sitting in this little chair, and you got this little tiny desk like you did for those placement tests right, the desks are smaller and th- the uh_ the table_ er the_ the guy in front of you is even closer. so you try to put your, knee up you're kicking somebody in the back of the head it's a really big pain in the neck, took all my exams in there that's why i didn't do so well here at the University of Michigan. moving over here is Angell Hall, Angell Hall pretty much speaks for itself a lot of great stuff in a lot of administration buildings etcetera etcetera etcetera. any questions before we move on to the coolest part of the tour? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is that where the Fishbowl is? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's where the Fishbowl is. what is the Fishbowl? everybody's wondering what the Fishbowl is Fishbowl is one_ you'll see it on the third day. unless you're an engineer. uh then you won't see it, um you'll see a cooler building actually but um the Fishbowl is a big big big room, and it has, about three hundred computers in it. one of the largest um... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (here's) a mystery chew. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh my god. i dropped a mystery chew. has about three hundred computers in it and's one of the biggest computing sites on campus, uh University of Michigan houses more computers than any other facility in the United States except Microsoft and NASA. whoa. lots of computers so the question is do i bring my own computer? obviously you don't have to cuz you can find a computer somewhere else because we got that many computers i guarantee there's probably gonna be one available. if you're willing to walk a little bit. who wants a mystery chew? takers for the mystery chew? Adam's got the mystery chew, threw it on the ground, last part of the tour          <EVENT DESC=":10 PAUSE WHILE WALKING"></EVENT>          ooh careful careful back up back up. alright. this is the most, sacred and beautiful part, of campus. this is the M and i know you guys think you know what the story is, i know you guys think you know everything but you don't. i'm telling you now you don't know the story of the M before we talk about the story of the M though because it's one of my favorite stories we're gonna talk about the story about the pumas, which are in front of the Nat Sci Aud- er Natural Science Museum. pumas in front of the Natural Science Museum cuz they're gonna come into play later there are two big stone pumas in front of the Natural Science Museum and who knows what those_ that story is? every time        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you gotta run, like naked (a in front of them) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no no no shh. that's coming up.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          next? come on everybody knows.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you mean like the bell ringing (and you have to run back and) (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah that's true but there's something else. okay so what everybody always thinks, they always tell people on the campus day tours and the other campus day tours, you know when you got your parents with you they always say, every time, um, Michigan beats Ohio State the pumas roar. well, we beat Ohio State all the time. and they're stone. they're not roaring i'm sorry it's not gonna happen. so actually what is true is every time a virgin graduates from University of Michigan, the pumas roar. and as they're, stone, they've, never roared. anyway so that's the legend just wanted to throw that out, for the little thing there, moving on to the last part of the tour this is the M. very sacred and, actually geographical center of campus, this is the M. the M was actually just refinished all this area right here (all) around, it was_ used to be blue this blue part right here uh we- used to be blue but it's not blue now it's rose or salmon or whatever the hell color you wanna call it, and they just sent it to England last year to have it refinished last summer this whole area was completely redone so you're standing actually in the new Diag, um and it's a lot more light_ lit than it was before like i said i was playing frisbee here (at) two o'clock in the morning, we're gonna come back from the comedy troupe thing at night and you_ we probably are not going to go through here but you look over here you see this wow i mean it looks like, what do you call it Close Encounters of the Third Kind man it's just like all lit up it's totally cool people study out here under these lights, two o'clock in the morning i'm not kidding at all, so anyway, really neat refinished and everything like that so what's what's the story about the M? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can't step on it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> shh. see i don't want you to screw up the story, see i appreciate your efforts but you can't screw up the story cuz everybody's got their own version of the story and everybody always tells their version of the story, and it's wrong i guarantee it this is the only story, here. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz it's your story. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz it's my story and i only tell the truth, i never lie. so anyway, currently stepping on the M why am i allowed to step on the M? i just graduated from the University of Michigan and i've already taken a bluebook. what's a bluebook? a bluebook is a big thick wad of paper. with a blue cover on it. and wh- if you take a class like econ, take a class like oh i don't know philosophy, sociology, history, those kind of things. involves a lot of reading and writing. you're gonna probably take an essay exam. that essay exam is gonna be given in a bluebook, if you are to disrespect the M...          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> eat the bluebook </U2>
          if you were to disrespect this M and step on it inappropriately, you're gonna fail that bluebook because you have acquired the curse. i, i didn't do that. i wanted to respect the, M until after i took my first bluebook and i took that bluebook on my birthday, October twenty-seventh, so you can all send me cards, my freshman year, and i aced that bluebook. i did i studied, i didn't step on the M and i aced that but somebody else. they stepped on that M they studied hard too, they got an A as well but they still acquired the curse. and they should've failed their bluebook and it's coming later it may not come right away, sometimes it takes awhile but, they're gonna fail, at some point. the only way to reverse the curse, is to strip completely naked from this spot and run all the way to the pumas over there by the Natural Science Museum and give 'em a kiss          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          on the face run all the way back and, get dressed by the stroke of midnight according to the Burton Tower. that's the only way to reverse the curse. so, the night before bluebook exams hundreds and hundreds of people are running naked, no not really but, it'd be pretty cool if they were. so anyway, that is that, about that. are there any questions? no. you guys are so quiet so quiet all day today        </U1>
