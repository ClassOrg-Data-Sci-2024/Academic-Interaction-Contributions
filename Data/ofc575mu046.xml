   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> numerical value or your cutoff value the point that indicates where you should reject and where you should accept H-naught, depending on which side you fall. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then so that would_ like, assuming that these are the right numbers,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          that would be          <OVERLAP1> the number </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> compared </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          that i get and i would compare that to, the, value on the chart.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right.          <OVERLAP1> exactly. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and if </OVERLAP1>
          the value on the chart is smaller or larger?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it depends on what your H-one and H-naught look like you need to set up your hypotheses so there's really some good, you know there's some good practice to start, identifying and doing with each problem, alright? set up H-naught and H-one, and write that down even if it's in the text already, you know telling you to test these hypotheses write it out so you visually see it each time. so you identify in particular H-one which tells you what direction, cuz that direction will tell you whether you reject if it's small, large or what way you go. okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="RE" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> do you have a little piece of tape? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="RE" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> thanks... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so an- setting up H-naught and H-one. in this example, four-eleven, you're trying to see there is a significant difference in the effectiveness. when you hear the phrase is there a difference or not, you're not looking for A being better than B or B being better than A you're just looking for a difference. so, if the differences are all about zero on average there's really no difference between the two methods. if the difference on average is not zero, then you say there is a significant difference. so i'm looking for a two-sided test. okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> this is </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          any difference as long as it doesn't turn out to be the exact same thing?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm i mean what what you're gonna be doing then is you're gonna seeing the differences were what? five negative-one two, there's some negatives some positives and you're trying to say whether they on average are about zero, or whether on average they are different from zero. mkay and you're gonna ches- tecks, check that with some significance, level mkay? so you wanna set up hypotheses, and H-one is the one that will gear what your region looks like, overall okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm um when is it appropriate to use a T-test and when isn't it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you have a couple different T-tests. all the T-tests so far though are really geared at what type of assumption that your sample sizes are,          <OVERLAP1> small </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> small </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm you do the Z-test versions where we have them, if your sample sizes are large cuz really what you're doing is falling off that T-table, and going to the Z-percentiles anyway. you're basically doing it as if it's a normal distribution overall. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay when is a good point to decide whether it's larger or small though? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what was the cutoff we mentioned? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> thirty. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> thirty </OVERLAP1>
          thirty observations is the rule of thumb the book uses and so that's the rule of thumb we'll use too. you guys can pull up a table top, you can sit on the floor over here, maybe we can move this case possibly... is that alright? just          <U2 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="RE" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so it's </OVERLAP1>
          out of the way          <U2 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="RE" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U2>
          we can get more people here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i have a question about four-point-nine, just          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          a small part of it um, i figured_ i did the whole problem and figured out D-bar,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          and, S-sub-D but that i think is where i had the problem i didn't_          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i got eighty-one for that and        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm you          <OVERLAP1> should have a </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> you had </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          whole range of values that you square here.          <OVERLAP1> this is </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> how do you mean? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> see that's a sum that means y- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but the sum of D-I is thirty i added all those. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> nope that's not the sum of D-I it's the sum of these differences, squared across each difference you do it for each difference you take two minus three squared,          <OVERLAP1> eight minus three, squared </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> ah oh </OVERLAP1>
          oh i see.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> ten minus three negative-eight minus three and square all those. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh that's so long. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it is long but you have a cal_ is this yours? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you have the ability to do it right in there.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i know. </U2>
          yeah. okay?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and if you can_ you know all it means is entering these differences in a list          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and doing your one variable summary measures.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          okay?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and get it that way.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and in general that number, is easy to be calculated or it will be so easy that the differences will come, very nicely.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i have_ i </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> how do you do stuff on the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          on a calculator.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what calculator do you have? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> T-I eighty-five. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay eighty-five i'm not as familiar with overall, what i might wanna suggest is maybe at the end of the session i can show you a couple things. okay? mhm? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh as far as four-point-nine,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um for the ninety-eight percent confidence interval,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          without an alpha        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we do? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what's the ninety-eight percent giving you really? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh true we already have          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>

          alright.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i wanted to ask about what number was that? two-point-five. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> two-point-five? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah the answer in the book was not what i got and i wanted to make sure_ i wanted to see          <OVERLAP1> if it was wrong. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> answer in the </OVERLAP1>
          book is not guaranteed to be right.          <EVENT WHO="S10" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          mhm. with that many questions that they're giving answers for they may get some wrong.          <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          two-point-five is doing the test on the previous exercise data, that there is a higher mean response for treatment one, and these are l- definitely large sample sizes seventy-nine and sixty-two, so what did we, do for our your your test statistic in particular is that what you're looking at?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> we are looking for a direction here it's going to be a Z-statistic. what did you get for your Z-statistic value? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i got negative-two-point-nine-four. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh i have negative-two-point-two-two, but i'm </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's negative-two-point-two-two cuz that's what i got. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep okay, so you might need to check whether you plugged in your sample variances correctly or your sample s- standard deviations? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> is the um_ i- is it the top </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what did you get for the numerator? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> for the numerator i got negative-nineteen. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> correct. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then for the bottom i got six-point-four-seven. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that should be about eight and a half. </U1>

          and two group two and call it Y-bar just for consistency purposes. but and it_ you just need to know_ and it really truly doesn't matter which way you do it cuz if you did your confidence interval switching 'em around, instead of getting a confidence interval and going from two to eight you've got it going from negative-eight to negative-two.        </U1>

          you make the same decision it's just that keep it in mind which direction then you're going if it's a direction you're headed. if you're trying to say one's better than the other then you should have certain types of numbers positive or negative. so it truly does not matter. but if it d- is set up, you know the X data is this here's group one then keep it that way. mhm.          <OVERLAP1> alright. </OVERLAP1>

          you wanna still find the P-values you normally would, and then, point-O-five is a good rule of thumb to use in general. what i would do though is check the answer with both one five and ten percent all three, because then you might say well if i make the decision that it's the same for all three of those then i pretty much know what my decision should be, okay? if your P-value turns out to be so small that you'd reject for all those levels then go ahead and say so. if it's in between, for some alphas you'd reject for some you wouldn't, then say you know for alpha point-O-five we would reject H-naught however, if alpha were one percent we would not quite reject H-naught, and then you're recording your results you're telling me you know how to do a test if alpha were given,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          in an exam we generally will give you the specified alpha cuz in any clinical study or anything there is a determined alpha that is set ahead of time. so you will have that given.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay that's the one that's a little different, i mentioned in a lecture a little bit. most of the time our hypotheses in this chapter chapter ten are looking for a hypothesized value of being zero, right,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          cuz you're looking for whether the two are equivalent or that they're not and maybe they're not in a certain way here's one where they actually wanted you to test something that wasn't zero.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          but it's still the easiest thing to do, alright? you made your confidence interval in part A?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what did you get for a confidence interval in part A? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> um ten-point-two-eight and thirteen-point-six-four. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. ten to about thirteen and a half right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          alright there's a range of what i would consider, plausible potential values, for, mu-one minus mu-two, hm? values that i think are likely to be mu-one minus mu-two at a ninety-five percent confidence level... and what they're asking for is t- for you to test the hypotheses, just looking at that does it indicate to you there that it might be ten as a possible value just as_ to get a feel for what the answer might be?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> um yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> is ten reasonable? take a look at ten the value ten? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> is ten inside that interval? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> ten is not a reasonable value according to the interval          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          okay so we probably are going to what end up rejecting or accepting? what do we think?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> rejecting. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> probably rejecting. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> rejecting. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> all it requires us to is to adjust our test statistic a little bit. you're gonna calculate, or you already have calculated X-bar and Y-bar, but you wanna now see whether that, difference in the sample means is significantly different from ten, okay? significantly higher than ten so you're gonna subtract off ten instead of subtracting off zero.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. </U2>
          and then still divide by that standard error, that's your test statistic now. and you do the test the same way you would with any other two observed test statistics. its degrees of freedom will be the thirteen degrees of freedom, and you've done the test so you just adjust what you subtract off as the hypothesized value.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so to just say that, because ten's not in the ninety-nine percent confidence interval, that's not enough to say that          <OVERLAP1> it's not? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> not quite. </OVERLAP1>
          yeah i wanted to look at our interval just to get a feel. the thing is there's two things that are not quite right here to be able to do that and be our answer alone. that is that the confidence interval when mu made was ninety-five percent, and they want you to do the test at a one percent. so those are different right there, and your ai- your part B test is not a two-sided test. your H-one your alternative is trying to say whether mu-one minus mu-two is more than ten, so you're looking for a direction and you can't test a confidence interval confidence intervals are two-sided. there are such things as one-sided confidence intervals but we don't go through those, in this class anyway. so you really do need to perform the test. the test is performed though by just adjusting your test statistic and subtracting off ten, when you compute it, and then still doing it as a T-test that is upper-tailed, with an alpha level of point-O-one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> for the_ for that T-one you would have to have the standard deviation divided by N minus one, with that one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> the standard deviations will always have an N minus one in them. when you_ but you are given the standard deviations already computed for you. take a look at page four-twenty          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          you don't have to do anything with N minus one, as far as calculating cuz the Ss are given to you.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you just square 'em and add 'em? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so yep you wanna do the same thing for how you do a T-test here you have to get your S-P... you have to get your S-P, and then have one over N-one plus one over N-two. so you have to get S-P from your two Ss, for that formula for combining the two. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the S-P would be the S-one minus S-two? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> nope S-P has the formula and, it's a pretty complicated one but it's about, averaging or pooling, we wanna take a look at page... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you have to take the square of          <OVERLAP1> that? </OVERLAP1>

          you have to square each of them you weight 'em by the degrees of freedom, the formula's on the top of page four-fifty. for the actual formula for finding your pooled, weighted average estimate... page five_ four-fifty four-fifty.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh four fifty </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep. that's your formula and you know what i really_ as i mentioned in the lecture, pull out your formula sheet start working with your homework with a formula sheet then you don't have to flip pages you've got it right next to you, and you start really feeling comfortable with the way the formulas are presented there, for your exam for next week. they're all all the formulas are there you're not gonna have to memorize any formulas, all we don't do is we don't put a scenario in there and calculate the T for you and then write out the conclusion and everything. so that's why i want you to understand the process but then have the ability to use the formulas that they've provided. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so this one at the top S_ is your S-P and then you've gotta, multiply that by the square root of </U1>

          we were looking for a difference of ten or more. mhm.        </U1>

          it gives us um_ it says, that they did a comparative study on measurements of          <SIC> absorbic </SIC>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh there's a couple give- giveaways that will tell you what to do without even thinking hardly at all, right? basically every study is trying to compare two groups, and yes they're trying to make the groups somewhat comparable with the ex- exception of a difference in, you know s- one aspect and seeing whether that aspect is significant or not. the thing is did they directly match and pair one-to-one one from this group and one from this group and put 'em together or are they really just two separate groups. when your sample sizes which are here ten and twenty. twenty um Peruvian, natives and twe- ten U-S subjects you can't have pairing. there's no way you could have paired twenty over here with ten over here. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so there is a ten group of ten and an independent group of twenty, that i'm comparing overall. okay...?          <OVERLAP1> versus_ </OVERLAP1>

          lemme and_ versus... even if your sample size is the same for example two-point-two-three, on page four-twenty-three, is about six rats an- that received a growth hormone and six control rats. there's six and six. could there be pairing there? not because of the way they gave you the summary data, the only way you can do a paired design, a paired T-test would be that you have the ability to either calculate the differences, or you have the differences to work from. so you can get D-bar, and you can get the standard deviation for the differences. when you just have, not the six observations for each group but the summary of X-bar Y-bar, those two standard deviations you can't get differences from there you can't get S-D from there you couldn't do it as a paired test. with this setup. and these are the two classic ways of giving data. summarizing by giving the mean and standard deviation already for you, or, in the case when it is, paired as in section four, setting it up so you have person or pair or household or farm number one. and there are the two responses for it. they always add another row, to tell you what pairing number it is. they make them link together. if you have data laid out and you say, look at those first two is there something they have in common? do they have to go together? they both came from person number one they have to be compared to each other. they have to be a paired observation. versus if i had ten people here and ten people here in two different teaching methods, that first person over here doesn't have to necessarily be paired up with this first person over here they just were two separate groups taught with two different methods that i'm comparing as a whole. overall. i didn't match them by gender or by pretest score or anything else i just_ i'm looking at the two test s- scores for the two teaching methods overall. but a lot of times the way the data's presented should indicate the idea along with a description of course of the problem. okay? if the sample sizes are not equal it can't be paired. if all you have are just two means and two standard deviations for these two groups, whether they're the same sample size or not it can't be paired. you can't analyze it as a paired situation. if you have the actual data, as in even two-point-two-one and it's listed out there and they look like they're the same number of observations, it doesn't guarantee it's gonna be paired. you have to still take a look at the description.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so in that example that would be independent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep what it_ basically they'd said, twenty workers were included in the experiment of these ten were selected at random and trained with method one. the remaining ten were trained with method two.          <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          that at random means that those two groups are independent.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that's how you can kind of pick 'em out if they're both laid out like that you can pick it out cuz w- that it'll always specifies that at random if it's not paired.          <OVERLAP1> and it'll always say paired. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean that-          <OVERLAP1> that's how that independence </OVERLAP1>
          assumption is usually meant by saying that i took the people and randomly allocated them into two groups. okay that's typically how it's done. or at least i went to this population of U-S citizens and picked a sample at random of twenty and i went to this population of Peruvian people and, picked s- ten at random though they're still supposedly independent samples then. okay that's how you distinguish between the two.        </U1>

          do a test, state the assumptions, so the- i mean there's        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> the assumptions the assumptions are, going to be usually in the summary also. the two basic components of any_ of all tests so far is that you've got random sample or samples. and you've got normal distributions. or you've got, the large sample sizes so you get the normality. but those are all the ideas but you still need to be able to say them correctly. rather_ you can't just say what are the assumptions random sample normal, no that's not enough you have to tell me what's a random sample, what's normally distributed what are you talking about there so you need to be able to say it in a sentence. alright? in terms of the actual, assumptions, section four page four-thirty-one, paired design, there's the assumptions right in that blue box. so maybe when you're practicing for the exam and you get your f- you have your formula sheet to study from maybe you write that out next to that on the formula sheet so every time you go to that to look at and do you remember that assumption with it. but you have small sample inferences about the mean difference assume that the differences are a random sample from a normal distribution. that's what you have as an underlying assumption for the paired T-test for the confidence interval. every confidence interval along with its test that go hand in hand have the same assumptions underlying them. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> what's assumption again? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> assumption is what does the data have to be in order for this inference procedure to work? you know we we talk about this ninety-five percent confident, and we say that means if you were to repeat it over and over ninety-five percent of these intervals are gonna contain the right quantity, well that only works if you really are taking random samples. and you have normality to begin with cuz you're_ what are you doing in your, you're using a T-distribution which comes from the fact that that's what you should get when you sample from normal curves. T-curves for the test statistic. so those assumptions only can help to some degree. there's a little robustness. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it is actually normal with some mean difference, and some standard deviation but you don't even have to write that notation you can just say from a normal distribution.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U2>
          and that's adequate. it's not_ your differences and your data's not gonna come from a normal zero-one, that would mean all your observations have to be around zero. no they come from some normal distribution that might be normal, zero-one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so so the confidence interval again what you said was um, if you're doing it over and over again say it's ninety-five percent ninety-five percent of the time, this will be included in the interval or          <OVERLAP1> what's </OVERLAP1>

          inter- don't interpret your confidence interval level, with just one interval. you should interpret it as being looking at many intervals. it's wrong to say ninety-five percent of the time the mean mu will be in this interval. that is not correct.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          cuz mu is either in that one interval or it's not.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          ninety-five percent of the intervals, made with this method if it were repeated, are expected to contain mu. i'm emphasizing the plural intervals... i can talk about the collection of possible intervals and what i expect for that collection. i can't talk about every one interval cuz either it does or doesn't. mkay they did have a pretty good picture back in chapter eight, when they first introduced confidence intervals to kind of remind you of that idea, and i knew we kinda sketched the idea but it's page three-twenty. back three-twenty... and, the example six on page three-twenty-two are both good ones to maybe recap that idea again. but see how every one interval either does contain the parameter,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          or it misses it.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you're talking about the collection of intervals if you were to repeat it many times, and we'd expect ninety-five percent of them to be yes to be good ones. the one that i got i don't have no idea which one it is. mu which one it measures up to. i don't know whether mu's in it or not, but i know that the procedure is such that ninety-five percent of the intervals... made with this method in repeated samples, are expected to contain mu. that's why i have confidence in the one i have. that's how i can say it.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay. </U2>

          basically anyway. so you can call it a Z if you wish but you don't even have to keep it a T do it with the sixty degrees of freedom and it really is a T-test          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but what i- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but it's </OVERLAP1>
          it's so close to n- a normal zero-one that you're, basically doing the same thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> what if you wanted to find a confidence interval though for something large? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well again you would basically can use the Z-alpha over two number in there instead of the T one. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's all the same formulas. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm it's the same formulas though just T versus E. mhm. if you always do it as a T-test which is by the way the pair design is presented. it doesn't present a Z version of it really you will always be correct. it's just that when you get to degrees of freedom on your T-table,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          where are you gonna be? way down at the bottom. possibly even at the very end          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          which is your Z-percentiles anyway I-E you're doing it as a Z-test.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's_ everything's_ it_ this this is not how it was for the,          <OVERLAP1> independent of A </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right they give you both versions. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          so if it's large we do the um, the T-test          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          only when we_ it it comes onto alpha we're looking it up on the Z-table.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah or you can look it up on the T-table the very last          <OVERLAP1> column or row </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          with the alph- uh infinity degrees of freedom, is your Z-percentiles. that is what that is there your computer output doesn't say T versus Z. it just does it always as a T-test. no matter what the sample sizes are. and it has ability to have actually T-distributions with a hundred degrees of freedom or three hundred degrees of freedom cuz it can do it that way so it's very precise.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          it's just that if you were doing it by yourself, and it was three-hundred degrees of freedom, your answer as a Z-test wouldn't be hardly any different from their answer calling it a T. and doing it that way. okay? over here.        </U1>

          the whole problem or actually get to part C, and read that part C also it tells you that what they're doing here is they're taking the same data, and it really was paired,          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          and they're saying let's pretend that data came from a situation where it was not paired. so you're not using the information of putting this one with this one and comparing it directly.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          you're just comparing the two groups completely as a whole independently. and it turns out that in four-thirteen, you say you would reject H-naught. strain A is significantly higher than strain B.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>
          yet when you do it as an independent samples design not using that pairing aspect... you end up accepting H-naught. if you analyze it with the S-P, and the T-statistic for, independent samples you're doing the T-test for independent samples here.        </U1>

          mm they have one-point-eight-nine-five, reject if it's more than that, seven degrees of freedom, upper five percent... and so, the idea here that they're getting at, is that the calculations_ the data were the same. however the standard errors get to be different because you didn't use the pairing aspect you didn't work with differences. the reduction, in variability, helps to make the pair design better. i've got a bunch of observations over here and they vary. and here's another bunch of observations and they vary too. now part of the reason why they vary is because they came from different farms. but these came from the same set of farms so i should put them together so that i compare an apple to an apple and look at that difference due to the treatment alone, the same two plots from the same farm. and i'm using that extra information. so that if this_ if this farm_ if one farm was unusually high, it would probably unusually high for both strain A and strain B. but the difference then the gain in the difference of those two strains would be masked coming out directly. versus if you just kept 'em as two independent sets a very large observation here does not get directly compared with a very large one here. and even though_ and that_ you aren't using that aspect you're not reducing variability due to_ from farm to farm by pairing 'em. reducing variability is usually always good. cuz that means you're then_ you're gonna able to compare things more accurately, and see if there's a difference or not. so by pairing you reduce the variability from farm to farm, by comparing directly, and you were able to see the significant difference, in these two strains. whereas that variability, among the farms, not comparing them with pairs, masked out the actual increase in strain A over ba- strain B. and so you didn't see it, when you did- treated it as independent samples. okay one of the pros and cons section they mentioned about pairing helps to reduce variability, in responses cuz you're comparing one item that is very like to the other the only difference is the treatment so you're getting a better idea of what the treatment effect really is. whereas it's harder to measure it if you've got independent samples because there's other things that are affecting those things. over there.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> independent mhm i had ten altogether, i just randomly picked five i didn't take the ten drivers and kind of analyze their driving habits and try to put two together as a pair, to say these guys are both are a little a little fast on the throttle or whatever you know they didn't try to match 'em they just picked five, and assigned them to one group. so that's how they're doing it they're doing it as an independent samples design. small sample sizes so we'll have to get S-P, and calculate the test statistic that way, an alternative design for the study would be though, to make the comparison more equivalent by doing some kind of pairing.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          how would you compa- pair 'em, maybe by driving habits how many accidents they had that might indicate whether they're a reckless driver or not and you put 'em together by, whether they're reckless or not reckless something like that. whenever you can make the drivers, that's one way what would be another way,          <OVERLAP1> that would even be better? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          um the ten drivers and you have H-one driver A H-one driver,          <OVERLAP1> B? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> perfect </OVERLAP1>
          exactly. mhm. if you have the same person driving both routes, then you have that same characteristics in the driver affecting both answers and the differences would be due to the routes perhaps more. than just the driver differences. very good.        </U1>

          do all that? were you in one hundred, or not? no that's where we did it all too... in the eighty-five you also have the ability and it's all under the, stat button.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          mkay? and under stat you have calculating things and editing things.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. </U2>
          so under edit, it says okay you're gonna edit two possible lists, or just one all you do is just keep those names and hit enter enter, and you've already got some data there.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm. </OVERLAP2>

          okay so you can type in your eighteen, your twenty-four, i'm putting them in as Xs i'm putting on the thirty        </U1>

          then i can go back out you can go back to calculate so i'm gonna go back to stat, calculate, and there's_ there i'm getting the same two names those are the ones i wanna work with one-bar. i push one-bar, there's your X-bar, and there's your standard deviation.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay. </OVERLAP2>

          okay? so you put in some data maybe you wanna put in your strain As or your differences if that's what_ if you've calculated your differences.        </U1>

          or just down down yeah there you go and now you can enter data.        </U1>
