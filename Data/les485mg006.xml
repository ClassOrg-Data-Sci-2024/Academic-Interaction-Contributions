   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> today, what i'd like to do, is to finish up our sort of, first seven weeks of the course which are taking eight and a half weeks, of, of the... interaction of classical fields, with, atoms or molecules... and later on today we'll start, some aspects of the quantized nature of the field. the assignment for next time looks long, but it's actually much shorter than all, all of our other assignments, because, we're now entering into an area, where... it's not so, much my area of expertise so that, i can't make up such long problems, uh, hopefully educat- problems that are educational but, these are more standard s- problems which, are fairly simple and take only a page rather than, three and four pages so even though it looks longer, it's really, one of the shortest assignments of the, of the semester. the material, actually on that again, the material that we're going to be starting to use, is really, covered pretty well in, Mandel and Wolf so that, starting with the quantized field i think that if you use the text and i i emailed you, various sections that we're covering, i think that'll help you and you'll be able to go ahead. in fact one of the homework problems i think is actually solved at the end of the Wolf, and also, the first volume of Cohen-Tannoudji's book, on uh Introduction to Electrodynamics, interaction of atoms with fields is on reserve at at the uh, science library, that's also, covers this the material. but it's also covered in almost any, basic quantum optics book. but before we get there let's start and just_ i wanted to finish up again, what we had last time on the Ramsey fringes. the physical experiment here and developed by Ramsey, is one in which you have something an atomic beam, that passes through two field regions. and the idea here is to get a line shape eventually, that will, be narrower in frequency than, you would've, had if you did, C-W spectroscopy, and you would've been limited by the transit time the amount of time the atom stays in the, field interaction regime. here we're assuming that the atom really, doesn't spend very much time in the field interaction regime we're assuming short pulses, but that there's a time interval between pulses, which, in the atomic rest frame is just L over V-X, where V-X is the longitudinal velocity, and V-Z is the transverse velocity or V-perpendicular, in this case. so the idea of the experiment is you detune the laser field, from the, atomic transition by a certain amount, you send the atoms through, and you measure the population of the atoms, just as they exit, the field region, you can do this in a number of ways field ionization, or just probing it with another, if it's in the R-F domain with another radio frequency field. does everyone understand the experiment? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you do that for both fields right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> excuse me? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you check after each </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> no you check only after the second field. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> only after the second </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> only after the second field you check for the population. alright? so just right here, you check for the population. now what's physically going on here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> (between) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> (between) the (out) field </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> it_ both fields have the same (between). </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright? normally the way you would do this, is you would take this field, and send it down via some uh corner cube or something else and get it. i- i- i- in the case of optics in the case of R-F you would have two cavities, that you would be sending the atoms through and you would have to weight the cavities to, to uh, make sure that the cavities have a, fixed relative phase. so this is what's happening, and we wanna measure the population so physically, what's going on here? this is what_ you can_ once you understand that then i think uh things are are fairly straightforward. what you're doing what you're going to be measuring here, is, essentially a difference in phase. (xx)? the first pulse actually starts a clock. you can think of it as starting a clock pressing down on a s- on a stopwatch and starting a clock, and the second pulse then, stops the clock          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          alright? so which phases are we actually comparing, with this start and stop? if you think of this this way you won't get confused cuz a lot of times people get confused they say well look, the pulses are off we have the natural frequency here or how do we get anything in this experiment? if you think of it in terms of these clocks i think you'll, figure out what's going on. what phases are you comparing?          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          there's only two frequencies in the problem... aside from Doppler shift. one is the frequency of the,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> atom </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> field </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you got 'em both alright?          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          one is the frequency of the atom          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> atom </U2>
          and one is the frequency of the field          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> field </U2>
          and how much frequency does the_ how much phase does the field go through in the time interval between the pulses?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um... (that) length? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh think of it in terms of time it's easier, how much phase does it, go through...? its frequency is big omega, so it's just </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> omega </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> omega T </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> omega times T, big T. and how much phase does the atom, the dipole that you've created go through? if its natural frequency is little omega? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> little omega times T </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> little omega times T. so what's the difference in phase?          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> delta times T </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> just delta times T </OVERLAP1>
          so all you're doing is measuring, this relative phase, of the, of the field, and the atom. the atomic oscillator. and that's what a Ramsey fringe does, the measurement does. it takes, and it lets you compare, two frequencies and this is very important because you can make f- laser frequencies very stable, and you're trying to get atomic frequencies maybe as a standard as a time standard, so this lets you, essentially get a very precise way as we'll see, of creating some type of standard, time standard. and in fact this is what's used now.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> so there's no Doppler phase </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> there is a Doppler phase we have to look at it and see what's involved with a Doppler, phase. which we did that last time but i'll redo it again, today. now any question on the physics once the physics once you got the physics then the rest is, is is mathematics but it's i- it's really, a- and there are some, important applica- implications of the Doppler shift as well, so we have to look at that. alright everybody any questions on the physics? alright? stop_ start and stop of a clock, so that last time we calculated in fact what W is, right after the second pulse, and that's_ we're interested in rho two two, or W, it doesn't make a difference really. and W, is just sine A-one sine A-two and those are the areas of the pulse, E-to-the-minus-gamma-T, cosine delta-bar T, where delta-bar          <WRITING TYPE="ON BOARD"> equals delta plus K V-perpendicular. </WRITING>
          which is K V-Z, and then there's another term, which, has cosine A-two, but doesn't depend on delta... that's just essentially the part of the ground state that went through without, getting excited, and we're not really interested in that. so we can neglect this part,          <EVENT DESC="CROSSES OUT SOMETHING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          not that it's not there it'll give you some background, but it doesn't depend on delta. now remember we're gonna look at our signal as a function of delta...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but aren't you gonna record that when you make the measurement y- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's a background so it affects </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so how do you get rid of it? i mean, you, have to have          <OVERLAP1> some </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it doesn't </OVERLAP1>
          make a differ- in other words even if you have a background signal          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          that's a constant, and that's not what you're interested in, so it may affect your signal to noise, but it won't affect the the shape of the signal it'll just add, it'll add a D-C component to the signal, alright? now in fact, you can see that if you, judiciously choose A-one and A-two, you can actually make this term vanish identically, as well. alright if you take the first pulse pi over two pulse, and the second one, well i don't know if you can make them both vanish here, uh, if you take the second pulse pi over two this vanishes... so it doesn't look like you make both of these uh this is sine-squared A-one over two, so, um          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>         <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          well i don't think you can make, both these vanish and that one not be uh, not be zero but if you just take, the second pulse, have an area of pi over two, then the f- this term vanishes anyway, because cosine A-two would be zero... so we have to calculate the integral of this over velocity and we need some velocity distribution, this is not in the vapor cell (now,) we have a beam, so there's some transverse distribution of velocity, due to the divergence of the beam, there you have divergence of the beam, and there's some distribution of longitudinal velocities. if we're a model energetic beam, what would the longitudinal velocity distribution be?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> two, you mean it'd just be constant? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> not constant if it was monoenergetic it would be a? delta function, it would be delta V-X minus whatever the, speed of the beam is, alright? monoenergetic means you have all the, atoms have the same longitudinal velocity, alright? now out of a thermal source you don't get that out of a supersonic source you can do a lot better, and you can use laser cooling techniques actually to get close to that. so let's, i just took a simple distribution, for the speed along the beam V-X-squared, typically in a thermal beam it might be V-X-cubed, times E-to-the-minus-V-X-squared just moves it out a little bit. but this is just a function that's peaked, at some value related to U-X. so we have to calculate, the          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          integral, of cosine, delta plus, K V-perpendicular, times T, now remember T is, L over          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          V-X, times W of V          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          now this is again related to integrals we've seen before, but, the important thing is that let's look at          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          K V-perpendicular... times T. and let's take some typical values. K is on the order          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          of ten-to-the-fifth centimeters-to-the-minus-one in the optical this is in the optical...          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          domain. let's take a thermal beam,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          V-perpendicular let's, let's take an angular divergence, of ten-to-the-minus-three that's a pretty small angular divergence. ten-to-the-minus-three radians        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> why they in the Doppler now they have, the exponential, um, Us, um U-X, uh, U, is that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is U-X-squared. alright that's, gives us the most, that's related to the most probable, speed along the beam </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> but here w- we have we have U-squared not </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> i know but this is a beam you_ uh that's in a that's in a cell, where U-X-squared average equals U-Y-squared average equals U-Z-squared average          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mhm </U2>
          when you have a beam that's collimated, the the, velocity in the transverse direction is, very small, that's what you mean by a beam right? if it was going all over the place you wouldn't have a beam          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> yeah </U2>
          and the velocity in the longitudinal direction is determined by the source, so (nubbin,) how the atoms come out along the beam, right so there's a different, probable velocity associated with the longitudinal motion, and the          <SIC> transversh </SIC>
          mot- transverse motion.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> okay </U2>
          alright?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> mm, yeah </U2>
          so for V-perpendicular in fact we take some theta, which is the beam divergence, times let's say five times          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          ten-to-the-fourth or something, centimeters a second, and let's take          <WRITING TYPE="ON BOARD"> theta dot ten-to-the-minus-three </WRITING>
          that's a very small beam divergence, so that's          <WRITING TYPE="ON BOARD"> five, times ten-to-the, one, </WRITING>
          centimeters per second. and the idea in these experiments is you want to make T large so let's take L about a meter, long, it's not, atypical, so we take          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          L equals a hundred centimeters...and V-X is also, let's take it thermal, where U-X is five, times ten-to-the-fourth, centimeters per second, alright? so if you multiply all those out, you end up with,          <WRITING TYPE="ON BOARD"> K V-perpendicular T, is on the order of ten-to-the-fourth... </WRITING>
          well what does that mean?          <PAUSE DUR=":11" ></PAUSE>          this is the Doppler shift that the atoms get because of their transverse motion, interacting with the field, remember they don't all have the same transverse velocity we have to integrate over it... and what's the_ for a typical atom what about its Doppler shift small or large? compared to unity. this is a phase. it's very large. so as we integrate over V-perpendicular, what'll happen to all these phases...?        </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWERS"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> they'll just cancel each other out </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what are you telling us with_ you're asking us, what that number means or what are you asking us with </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> in other words this number's ten-to-the-fourth, but we still have to integrate i just took a st- a typical V-perpendicular, we still have to integrate over V-perpendicular          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and since the phase for a typical atom is so large        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you're saying the same thing that you said before basically with the, with the          <OVERLAP1> phases </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> with </OVERLAP1>
          in- free induction decay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

          the catch is, remember when you did that homework problem this week, if you did it, with the stimulated photon echo,          <EVENT DESC="POUNDS DESK"></EVENT>          what's the only time you get a long signal...? a signal that will last for a long time?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> to get you the rho two two </OVERLAP1>
          remember we did it with the simulator we had both terms, as well we had rho two two,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and rho one one, and i have to think about it, and i'll try to bring it in next time to think of the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          the rho two two. but it's the rho one one that's critical, because that'll last a long time. now there's another subtle way to open up the system, not simply by other magnetic substates. when you take into account recoil, on spontaneous emission, that turns out, that it also opens up the system for different velocity classes. so the recoil of the atom uh we haven't done this yet, but the recoil of the atom, opens the system. so in that case, we can get effects here, that would be absent when we neglect recoil, but, are present when we include recoil. so these effects are intimately related to what? to the,          <EVENT DESC="POUNDS TABLE"></EVENT>          quantum nature, of the center of mass motion. and such, interferometers in which you need that effect, you can really call de Broglie wave, interferometers. because they really depend, on, the, quantum properties of the center of mass motion. they, they in the limit that H-bar goes to zero, these effects vanish. where in the other interferometers when you let H-bar go to zero, all the effects still stay around. they're not, intrinsically quantum effects, quantum_ related to the quantum, center of mass. and we have a collaboration with a group at N-Y-U Tycho Sleator if you came to his, talk here he gave the A-M-O seminar two weeks ago or last week, and, this is the type of interferometer that they've, been looking at, in their labs. and have seen these effects of, the quantization of the center of mass motion. so there's a lot of interesting physics here, we've just touched on it i just, wanted to illustrate that, you can, use the techniques that you've learned, at least, not that we didn't, look at quantization yet of the center of mass motion but we will, you can use the techniques that you've learned to analyze many many situations that are very important... any questions on this?        </U1>

(xx) because you're only looking for, the part that absorbed from this beam emitted into this beam, and that means that, that gives you a second harmonic E-to-the-two-I-K-Z. which means you have a coherence between P, and P plus two H-bar K. so these are the types of terms you have to start looking at, when you quantize the center of mass motion. and for these terms, it's no longer closed. alright? if you're really interested i can give you some references, if you wanna look at it some more, as to, how this comes about          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          any other questions any other questions we're sort of now we're done with the first, half of the course, which took a little more than half but        </U1>

       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> and he said most people wouldn't get it,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          wouldn't pass the exam. now... we'll talk about that a little bit as well in other words, what is a photon and what does it mean to say, a photon the word photon is used all the time, but for example it would be more correct to say in that, atom case where it emits, as it emits into a one photon state, of the system. it's actually not a single photon but a superposition of an infinite number of, single photons, single, infinite number of photon states, but it's a one photon state, and we'll see what that means, also... and i'll, give you the prescription for, quantizing the system, as well. well, we hafta start with some type of, classical system, that's the normal way that you quantize you look at a classical system, and you fudge around a little and you look for some Poisson brackets you look for something you recognize, and then you, quantize the system. in the case of the electromagnetic field, we have to start with some type of system, classical system. and you already know, that, for the classical electromagnetic field, things will depend on the boundary conditions... if you take a boundary condition like this, and you try to quantize the field, try to find the classical fields in there, what will you find?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> a mess? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> problems. alright? even if you take a spherical cavity, which is a nice system for using angular momentum states, to quantize the field, what will you find when you try to quantize those states? it's like quantizing in a spherical cavity? you get Bessel functions you get, all these combinations of Bessel functions, and, things are not the waves are not transverse, you get it's like, you're_ oh someone was talking about Jackson, this is the modes inside of a spherical cavity. if you take a box, then things get a little easier,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> (xx) </U2>
          but you still have to worry about, the boundary conditions at the say maybe the, the edges of the box and what's going on it's not so clear, as to what's going on. the point is no matter what you take for your quantization volume, if you let the quantization volume grow to infinity, then things won't, really depend, too much on how you've chosen, the quantization volume. so you might as well take the easiest one possible, or one of the easiest ones. and one of the easiest ones is, a, periodic boundary conditions. if you choose periodic boundary conditions, it just makes life easier you go on for infinite space, but we'll eventually choose, periodic, boundary conditions so that's the one we'll choose. however if you're dealing with a real cavity, you may not have a choice. inside a real cavity what will you have to choose?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is the way that you never run into trouble. if you look at the classical prop- for example if you have a beam splitter which we'll do later on... you should include as your system, include the beam splitter, in your system, and quantize the field, get the classical modes of the field, with the beamsplitter in... and we'll see how to do that, and then you don't run into any problem. and then you associate with each, classical mode, some quantized mode. and that's what we'll be doing. so that's the pep talk, the philosophy and then i, go through this. most of this is in the notes i'm not gonna_ it's_ as boring          <SIC> at is is </SIC>
          for you to look at it on the board, it's just as boring f- for me, to go through it, on the board, but i wanna just point out some of the details, and, remind you of some things you may know or you haven't looked at recently, that we'll need for what we're going to be doing,          <EVENT DESC="GOES TO BOARD"></EVENT>          so, dealing with infinite space in this case or periodic boundary conditions alright uh eventually, so we Fourier transform any field, F is any field variable. the electric field the magnetic field the, vector potential, something like that... and when we do that, we find this is F of K-T,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          we find that F of minus K-T is just the, F of K-T star. alright you just substitute in, F, F of R-T remember is real. so this is the transformation from, F of K back to F of R, and the Hamiltonian in free space... now we'll be dealing with a free field, it's just, half epsilon zero E-squared plus C-squared B-squared... and Maxwell's equations at least uh Faraday's law, and the displacement law can be written in free space, in the, in the K space, in this form. this would be normally, uh, dell cross E and this would be dell cross B. but the dell is replaced by K, in,          <EVENT DESC="COUGHS"></EVENT>          excuse me, in, in Fourier space. so this is the starting point. now, this Hamiltonian          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          looks pretty familiar, almost... something squared, plus something else squared... what Hamiltonian do you have, where you have something squared plus something else squared?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> harmonic oscillator </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> harmonic oscillator P-squared over two M, plus one half K-X-squared. so it's tempting to think, that, i can assign one of these, E for example to momentum, and X, or X to momentum, and, B to, E to X-Q and B to momentum, and it will look like a harmonic oscillator. well you can't quite do that because the, commutation relations for the field, are not the same, as the commuta- or the Poisson brackets for the field are not the same, as the Poisson brackets for X and P, in the harmonic oscillator. but for certain boundary conditions it almost works out, that way. so the idea instead of doing that is to use a little trick. is to use some combinations of E and B, and then see if we can get the Hamiltonian written, in a new form that also looks, quite, familiar to you. so this is what we'll do. and let me get the, definitions correct. so we need to take alpha...          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          of K-T, which is a vector, which is, minus I, over two N of K, times, E, minus, C, kappa, cross B... where kappa is K over K. kappa's a unit vector. and these are tildes. so these are still in in Fourier space. N is just a normalization. we can choose it any way we want. it's just a number we're putting in. and we'll choose it, for some convenience in a few minutes. i did the calculations carrying it all the way through, to show you that there's nothing magical with N but then i, i decided that it's not worth, all that, you know. you can choose any- anything you want, but, it'll just eventually uh_ everything will (scat) with N, and we choose it in a certain way, to give, familiar results.        </U1>

N means the number of photons in a given mode of the field... so this is the quantization procedure you get a classical, box, you find the classical modes, and to each classical mode, you, essentially, apply, an A-H-bar omega A dagger A in the Hamiltonian... so let's stop here, we now, you can review this if you've forgotten it before next lecture, but i_ next time what i'll do is i'll start to talk about some properties of these, photon states, and we'll talk about what are called coherent states, i'm not going to do the phase operator in any detail. the phase operator's in the notes, and Mandel knows more about pha- a lot more about phase operators than i do. and he's worked on that extensively so if you look in Mandel and Wolf, he has both, which i'll talk about the Pegg-Barnett, definition of the phase operator and, what he's developed himself which are called operational, measures of the phase operator, which, disagree somewhat from the, Pegg-Barnett but there's a discussion in his book, about that. after, that i'll talk about coherent states, and then we'll talk about two photon coherent states or squeeze states, as they're called. okay? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so does your_ well, this is just a side question you were talking about </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="CHI"> excuse (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well one question at a time alright? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you were talking about how uh, the uh, your advisor said that </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that has to_ well the coherent states are strange states what it has to do with_ people talk about photons          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          but, you rarely ever, if you had a single photon state here, it would be in all of space          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          it could_ it couldn't interact with any (of the other)          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          so, what Lamb i think would agree to is that, the proper way to_ what you call a photon, are the corresponding, excitations of the corresponding classical modes, of the boundary value problem.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          if you associate with each of those modes, something, a quantum excitation which are called photons, you never have any problems.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh alright </U2>

          referred to as a, as a uh indication of its uh totally quantum mechanical effect so, that may be, some justification. you have to look effects don't, disappear as H-bar goes to zero          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          the          <SIC> Casimar </SIC>
          Casimir effect is one such effect, you're modifying the vacuum by putting it in plates, and it causes a force          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh right right right </U2>
          between the plates. but uh, i haven't thought about that enough i'm still, it seems to me... and there_ and there's a whole group that_ it's not so popular anymore but there's a whole group of people who, claim, that all the quantum properties of the fields, are always related to quantum properties of an atom, rather than the field so that, sorry for the atoms, remember we said if we excited one atom it would emit a, single photon state. but it_ it's really the_ the property of that field is related to the fact that we started, with a quantized atom. so there are, there are theories (oh,) i don't know if we'll get there this, semester but, what you can do is you can eliminate the fields, you can eliminate the uh, the fie- the the vacuum field in some sense, and write the electric field, totally in terms of, say atomic operators.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that's what- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's what's          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i (need help) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> called </OVERLAP1>
          source field, that's called source field theory, and, but these are quantized operators so that, you represent the quantized electric field, in terms of the, of the, uh atomic operators, and that shows you that all the quantum properties of the field, are in some sense related to the quantum properties of the atoms.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh are_ can you, can you spend any time or are we gonna spend any time talking about that because, that's what i, that's the piece i i seem to be missing to understand why coherent_ you mentioned that, coherent states have to do with the absorption, i think well at least we talked about it in in, field theory or whatever we call it, the quantum mechanics (xx) it was confusing me at first why, why you'd be interested in an operator that doesn't have eigenvalues... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> you mean coherent states, that's          <OVERLAP1> something else. but- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> coherent states. but </OVERLAP1>
          is, doesn't that relate to,          <OVERLAP1> absorption? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          it does relate to it but, coherent states are these weird things i mean Glauber when he, invented them or used them at least in, said you know people were very skeptical. and uh, but, what you can show is if you have any classical, current distribution, it generates a coherent state in the field.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well maybe it'll be more_ maybe_ maybe it'll make more sense          <OVERLAP1> when we talk about it next time </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but we'll talk about coherent </OVERLAP1>
          states, as difference i mean we'll talk about what, a coherent state is simply defined such, i'll do next time          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          such that its expectation values, give you, the classical field values.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          alright? that's that's the way it's defined so that, it's as close to a classical field as we can make it, by demanding that it's (xx) but when we demand that, we see that it has a very strange property, that, that the, (they're defined by the annihilation operator op- ap- anything under coherent state)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> give you the          <OVERLAP1> same thing </OVERLAP1>

          the same state so,) if you had destroyed a photon, how could you be back in the same state?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh yeah, that's what i need help with,          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
