   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright we have about a m- a minute before we get started and you're probably wondering what the hell is going on i told you i'd swear and i tried not to.          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you're probably wondering what the hell is going on. well first of all, first of all, chairs and seats are in different position and i believe some of the students came up to me and said i can't see a thing, so can we change it? and i don't care what you do, i don't see that much of anything in here believe it or not. i mean i do look at you,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but i'm not really interested in what the seats look like so i never noticed it. so it's up to you as to how you wanna put it. i have no strong feelings but i definitely do think that this is a lot better,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i like it a lot better. </U2>
          than uh, last week. we have one faculty member who, can_ only likes it in one of those, s- squares or, and like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> doesn't it work in this room? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it doesn't it, the room's just too small. so, that's, number one, okay so i like it better like this so if you guys wanna, i get the feeling you're gonna hafta always come in here and redo it. cuz i know, there may be that one person who loves it in the other position and, okay? and i have no control over that person believe me i have no control.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so anyway, um now this looks really strange, one day i was walking across campus, and uh professor John Swales came up to me and i know John Swales is sort of, the great birder John Swales. uh came up to me and said, uh gee we need to come to your class and tape you and i said why? he says well we're working on this great research project. i said well, okay and i also i, forgot to mention that he owes me about thirty-six hours of the best birding in the world after this, uh for having his research team come here and i forgot to mention in our haste last week, that uh, uh the research team from MICASE is that how you pronounce it?          <U2 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          MICASE would be here but they're they are from the University's uh Linguistics Department and this is Janine this is Bonnie and someone will probably wanna say something about it.        </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="R1" DESC="MICASE-RELATED SPEECH NEXT 1:53"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that Photoshop book is bothering me because i'm thinking that i'm in i'm in six-forty          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so, i am in Online Searching okay. when last we met, i believe, we, learned about_ more about controlled vocabulary searching, and i gave you, some searches to do this past week. so what i'm gonna first do, is handout, an example of a search, which i did quite awhile ago, on the effect of television violence on children. and if we aren't all sick of this, i i guess that there's s- something wrong with us but,          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i mean we've sort of beat this search to death. however it's a good example and, i'm sending this around to you to show you how, one online search can pretty much be done entirely using the online thesaurus. that looks good what is it?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's just spaghetti. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> spaghetti?          <OVERLAP1> mm </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's a can of sauce. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> is it cold or warm? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i he- i heated it up. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> heated up, mm looks good </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> are you hungry? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> pardon me? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> are you hungry? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i i just went over to the sandwich shop oh, right.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> i am hungry. you wanna pass that around. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">  i i think i tall- told you the story that i used to teach class from five to seven and i had this one guy come in once with, an entire meal of stewed, green, peppers,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          stuffed peppers, and they like smelled up the whole class and, you know, you could just tell that everyone was was, sorta, they were hungry.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          they were hungry. okay if you take a look at this search, you notice that i expand directly into the online thesaurus using the word violence. how do i know to expand directly or double-expand? well i've already looked through the thesaurus to determine, whether violence is a term i wanna use. and i look through those terms and i page to the second list of terms, and i select the ones online are one, violence are four to five, antisocial behavior and aggression, and lines R-eight to R-nine. i guess i did not, uh include any terms from the second, um screen of terms. okay if you turn the page, then i expand into the online tharus thesaurus using the word television, so i preface that with the, E expand abbreviation followed by television, in parenthesis... and again i get the display of the online thesaurus. and there's lots of, words bearing the word television so i select out of the first list the word television, the word broadcast television cable television children's television closed circuit television commercial television, then i page, and i guess i didn't want any terms from the next list and i paged again and then i- i went out and selected, line thirty-two and line thirty-six for television commercials and television research, and then i paged again... selected television viewing, and then i or-ed the three previously created sets for all those terms created using the, television browse or the television expand display. into set eighteen which represents my facet for television. then i expanded on children pretty much did the same and then i said hm there's lots of children terms, instead of, selecting from, the online thesaurus, what i did was the shortcut, select, children... slash D E and what did that give me? what did that give me? what did i retrieve?          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> reduces </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what am </OVERLAP1>
          i trying to accomplish there? yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> any, um, descriptor term that has the word children in in it somewhere. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> any descriptor, that contains the word children. whether it's a first word or the last word or if, the word children is embedded in the descriptor, that's exactly right, and so it gives me a shortcut, and then i combine all the previously created sets, for children violence and television. and i retrieve a hundred eighty-seven things which is about right. type out a few, and this whole thing took me a whole two-tenths of an hour which isn't very much. okay? so do you want any of these handouts or you already have one good.          <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i alr- </OVERLAP1>
          thanks.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so that's all it took me, it didn't actually take much thinking time. i just sort of expanded from the online thesaurus and then finally did that shortcut of a s- s- s- selecting the descriptor word. if you look at the last page, of this handout. you'll notice, that i... put a big box around... uh all the children descriptors. now of course the use-for terms are not selected but any of those valid descriptors listed in that list, those are the ones i retrieved, by entering the term children, slash D E. and some of you may think that some of these ch- these children descriptors may not necessarily relevant but i got all of 'em. and i was willing to take that risk. so, here's an example of how to do the search using the online thesaurus and an easy shortcut. there are several of you who did this search this past week, and, without going into extreme speci- specifics, about every term you entered um did anyone have a similar experience? anyone use the online thesaurus for that search? okay, and? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i thought it was really pretty easy. um i used it for the term instruction, when i was doing teaching methods for teaching support staff, word processing, and i'd known from the thesaurus i wanted pretty much everything that was, with instruction, in the thesaurus. um, but there was more on the online thesaurus so i did end up having to choose, the terms once i saw it but it saved me typing 'em all in </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so using the online thesaurus can be a good shortcut. okay let's talk about the search generally there are several people in this class who did the search. does anyone want to relate their experiences good or bad?          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>           <OVERLAP2> (neither one.) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whe- </OVERLAP1>
          you've now done three searches on this by the way.          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so you should've had it right, the third time hopefully no? anyone wanna share their experiences? yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, i'll share, um, g- DIALOG was extremely slow, so you type along. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what time did you, use it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> two o'clock </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> two o'clock </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> on? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> Thur- Wednesday.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
         <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U2>
          and so you'd type (tap tap tap) so you'd wait and it'd all pop up and then backspace backspace backspace once you realize you typed an error and then          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          but um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's actually more typical of like Friday afternoons, although, you know people say like around here on campus, that um, the busiest day is always Wednesday. for example people take off Monday and they'll take off Friday but Wednesday, everyone seems to be at work and everyone's working on Wednesday so maybe what happened was, you know you're just getting that, high load period. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i had, i had the um, preventing, pregnant teeche- teenagers from dropping out. and i, i had three boo-boos in my, search that i found out. i, had the word, dropouts but it's, one word and i, entered it in as two. so, error number one. so          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          then i included          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and then, so, then i had withdraw, parenthesis education. and i didn't know, is that considered one word so you can use slash D-F to search in a descriptor field?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> if you're ever in doubt what do you do? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> do it </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> do it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i did it both ways but, they still hit a, zero so, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> with          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> with that, zero </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that particular construction? </OVERLAP1>
          okay i- i have to take a look at it        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and then, then, after it was all done, i realized when i had, retyped in dropout as one word i forgot the slash D-F so i en- ended up,          <EVENT DESC="SOUND EFFECT"></EVENT>          yep.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so, it didn't search just the descriptor field as one word cuz i had it in my brain as two words.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i went ahead and did it and, i got about two hundred and fifty hits and, i took each term and did a single set, as i went along, and then combined them, after i was done with each facet. so, it took me a, little longer but uh, i was pretty happy with the results i got. </U1>

          you're in business. so, for those of you have used eighty-column punch cards do you remember those?          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          they were sorta funny looking for those of us who were very old and they sort of looked like this and, had a little side and they had little... okay those were, for the, i know some of you are looking at me saying what the heck's that?          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you probably don't even know what the catalog card is,          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but anyway these are eighty-column punch cards, where you had eighty spaces in which to say it actually it's less than this because this was identifying data, at least mine were there were thirty-three characters which are identifying data, and then you had the rest of the characters, what's eighty minus, fifty-seven?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> forty-seven. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> forty-seven. you had forty- s- seven characters for data. okay but for those of us old people that used to work in this environment that's what it was like and it wasn't that long ago. so basically you get a, two hundred forty, which is three cards.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and the way we used to know, how this happened i think it may be the same on Telnet it really allows you to go, eighty across, i believe, hit return another eighty down, and then hit return another eighty down it should. but if it doesn't, uh it's basically, three lines. yep?        </U1>

          okay. and then, it would be set one for children, set two for adopted children set, three for foster children set four for, grandchildren set five for the ordered set of all those. then, because you still want that result, and you're still building your facet for children, you could say select S-five or, hospitalize children... or latch-key children          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          or migrant children          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          or minority, group, children. i'm not writing everything else, out because i just don't, have enough, time, to write everything out. and so on and so forth okay? now if you still wanna enter in, i don't know maybe this is gonna, be what set six set seven set set eight, i don't know where it's gonna end, but let's say it ends at set thirteen? and here you say set thirteen or and more children descriptors, alright? okay? so you know that when you've entered your last set you've got your children facet, done. you don't have to look back necessarily and combine, maybe set eight and set, twenty, set eight or set twenty or set twenty-five or set thirty, to make your children facet. you're carrying it with you. by starting with, by starting with, the last, fa- combined, set here. yeah?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, in uh, uh, in, trying to figure out which uh, descriptors to use uh, i was thinking about antisocial behavior and trying to think to myself, you know would this be a good descriptor for this? and there are no scope notes on it. um, uh so i, i looked at the, i looked at the list of, narrower terms, essentially what they considered subsets, of antisocial behavior. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> excellent way to do it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, okay then, basically it all looked like, it virtually all looked like adult behavior the narrower terms are are, child abuse, uh driving while intoxicated, sexual abuse terrorism there are, a- a lot of others that imply adult rather than child activity and so on that basis, i,          <OVERLAP1> decided not to use it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> didn't use it </OVERLAP1>
          um,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> in the absence          <OVERLAP1> of scope notes this is uh this an an okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's, that's a good approach </OVERLAP1>
          to doing it that's what i do. another thing you can do is check the printed volumes if you have them nearby, to see, just like you did the first week, remember when you, used, ERIC? to see what citations are actually um, assigned to that descriptor. um, i think, here experience comes to bear. i think after awhile, you start to see certain descriptors, become familiar with them, see them more and more, and find, ah this will probably work.          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um... in this particular case antisocial behavior, in my experience and again i'm speaking more from experience, it won't harm you here, using it in this particular search,          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and i think it'll actually buy you something. so i would include it. and last week when we went through the search antisocial behavior was one of the descriptors we chose, okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that was why i was real careful before i threw it out.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, one of mine actually e- one of my descriptors was uh television behavior,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          which i found in the printed thesaurus, but, when i entered it in here, actually i made sure the, it's spelled correctly and i just ended up with a big fat egg.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know i just, my experience in searching in general in other systems has been that, usually, people don't wanna wave through to the end. they're gonna look at the first ten depending on, you know what their needs are. </U1>

          and then i expanded under each of those and i didn't, have as many under pregnancy, um, i limited it to, pregnancy slash D F and pregnant students. um          <OVERLAP1> may </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay, </OVERLAP1>
          i i would suggest to you, that there are some more          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          like unwed mothers, and early childhood or early parenthood or whatever it was, that there some others to use.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and, since there are so few, i would add more.          <U2 WHO="S15" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          on the other hand you got sixty citations so it didn't necessarily hurt but if you wanna be more comprehensive, you wanna add more descriptors. any other experiences on the search...? yeah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S16" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i used, the precoordinated, facet of pregnant teenagers as well as pregnancy, in teenagers and dropping out,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and ended up with two hundred and twenty-four, results.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, i got a hundred and twenty but i didn't use the slash D F on dropouts </U1>

          this would be the same. my next step, would be to and, this set, for library services with this set, for physical disabilities.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's what i did. </U2>
          okay? then i'd say to myself oh, i have, mm so many. do i need to reduce it? now at that point you may decide you don't wanna reduce it. you don't always have to reduce it. okay? so i build each one, and then, make a decision after looking at those whether to reduce it. on the other hand, you could go out and build that third set for all the other disabilities... so we have a, third set out here.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          for other disabilities          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          and we list all the descriptors whatever those disabilities are... and what we could do... is combine together, library services and, physical di- disabilities not, the other disabilities. now what we've done by doing this in one fell swoop is, we've never found out what the combination of these two is. okay? never found out the combination. you could combine these two together, and maybe get thirty-three, hits. now the not, condition, with the not Boolean operator is always going to reduce, your number of hits. if you do that one operation, library services and physical disabilities not other disabilities, then you haven't evaluated, this first condition here. okay? so that's how i would pr- proceed. now it sounds like, this was a complex search i mean it required, three sets with lots of descriptors in 'em. cuz there were lots of descriptors out there, and i think perhaps, in the process of, adding all those, you know typing all those terms in, uh trying to keep, uh... uh keep in mind what all your, facets were and what all your sets were, it sounds like you might have, incorrectly combined, combined, um, some terms that should have been, in this facet in that facet, and vice versa. okay? and this sometimes happens when we do a search but until i take a look at it i won't know. okay? alright any other experiences for this particular search? yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i um, got a reasonable number of sets, two ninety-six, for the results, but the way i did it, i think i really, uh screwed up the um, uh the wha- what's the Cutter's law. um, library services, i generated by, y- there're a lot of specific descriptors with not many man- many narrower terms simply used anything, uh that you know looked appropriate, from the scope notes. uh, and then we go to physically handicapped and other handicap was just my shorthand and um, then something like developmental disabilities it'll be four or five under it. um, i used developmental disabilities instead of listing all those under it. uh i got a dozen terms there, and about uh, and eleven nots.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>

          so it is an. i'm sorry for what this looks like it's just gone through, many many, uses and, i really like this handout. okay. the next field that's indexed, is that we encounter is the abstract and notice how, each individual word, in the abstract, is listed, and numbered. stop words, there's a line through them, but they're still, numbered. the number is never used it's never assigned and you'll never find it. but those stop words were always numbered they were still given some credit for being there. and later on you'll find out that that actually does make sense. if you turn ov- oh i'm sorry don't turn over. notice that that we go down to the descriptor field, and notice each descriptor, is numbered, whether it makes sense that it's the fourth descriptor word or the third descriptor word or the first descriptor word. so consumer, is descriptor number one word, attitudes is number two word, consumer is number three word and, behavior is number four word. so each individual, descriptor, they do not renumber them and start at one. okay? so if you're the twentieth descriptor you may be the, the forty-fourth word in a descriptor. okay? so the only fields here, that are shown, as the tandy fields are the title, the abstract and the descriptor. we don't have an example of a note we don't have an example of an identifier field here okay?        </U1>

          there's probably a descriptor code, which is indexed in that particular system, and you can search by that code number. that's probably a prefix code as opposed to a suffix code. and, descriptors are considered suffixes, i'm sorry tandy fields, are considered suffixes because if you wanna search for a word in the title, you wanna search for the word farm in the title, you put on the suffix, slash T I. or if you wanna search for... the word children in the descriptor field as a full descriptor, it's a suffix that you add on to the descriptor. prefix-coded fields for example if you wanted to search for the magazine Online, you'd say, i think it's J N for journal, equals Online. but, that's getting way ahead of ourselves so let's not worry about that right now, okay? we're only gonna learn how to do full-text Freetext searching, in, title and abstract note descriptor or identifier f- fields otherwise known as the BASIC Index fields. if you turn and look at the back of this handout... this is the next step that Dialog takes. Dialog lists, each, individual word. in the, title abstract descriptor note identifier field that is in all those BASIC Index fields it alphabetizes it, and then, it adds on, in what field it occurred, and what number, the word was occurred in the f- particular field what was the word position number of that particular word in that field. you follow me? okay? y'all sitting at the end of your seats?          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          hardly.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          why don't we take a twenty-minute break?        </U1>

          what does that tell me? i mean, aren't there some illogical constructions in here? there's some things you can never get, because some of these words will never necessarily be next to each other, withi- within the logic and i i i'm not quite putting it the right way but... if you mix these up, and tell reaction to be here and jerk to here well it can't be there while it's there and so on and so forth. so, only one N, per construction, that's it. if you wanna do more than one you'll have to use W.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          i don't think this is a good example, but you have to use W. you can string as many Ws along as you want. you can string them aga- ad nauseam. however, however we online searchers who have been around for awhile. and i've been around, and i've been around the block. find that if you, try to use, more than, four words, even three. with a W construction, you aren't gonna get anything. i would be very careful combining, more than three words, with a W. i would say that basically          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>         <WRITING> two words, is the limit... for, N... three words, is the limit, for W. </WRITING>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah just one thing if you save them too long then you lose, updated, articles wouldn't you? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it re-executes the </U1>
