          today, to give.        </U1>
       <EVENT DUR="5:15" DESC="STUDENTS TAKING QUIZ"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> when you're finished with your vocab quiz, would you, turn to the required readings (and for your_ her quiz_ ) required readings in lesson sixteen and, take out any kernel and modifier charts you might have had for those, from yesterday i wanna go through the, forms </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":09" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (apparently) that's an extra one... oh thanks, (Zack) </U1>

(okay?) and this is basically, a morphological... consideration when do i see a dative form as i go from left to right? and          <EVENT DESC="COUGHS"></EVENT>          excuse me, at this point, the next question is, do i have enough information... to determine, dative use? I-E, is it kernel, versus non-kernel, and then within those categories, do i know where i am...? if the answer to this is no, the next question is as i continue to read, from left to right, when do i have enough info?          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          what we wanna do is develop a strategy for, basically not panicking when we see, a form like a dative particularly one such as          <FOREIGN> cui, </FOREIGN>
          where there's a lot l- many levels of things you have to consider i've got a pronoun i've got a relative pronoun, i'm in a dependent clause, and it's in the dative case. but, we're just, looking at things going left to right, at what point do i know, a certain amount_ do i have enough information to make a decision? so looking at the first one um Andy can you read that one aloud, in Latin...? sixteen-one.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm,          <FOREIGN>           <SEG TYPE="READING"> cui fortuna favit multos amicos abit. </SEG>
         </FOREIGN>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm... how far into the sentence do you go before you see a dative word? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> first word. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, (we met)          <FOREIGN> cui... </FOREIGN>
          what do you know at this point...? (okay) do you have enough information to determine which use you have? in other words to classify it as being either kernel or non-kernel, just by looking at this dative word... John?          <OVERLAP1> (would) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (uh) </OVERLAP1>
          yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> how so? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz it's uh, relative pronoun's the first word in the sentence and when it's usually, first word in the sentence then it's gonna function as the (comp, relative to the) (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay yeah in in other words if we're at the level of clause,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          for my relative clause do i have enough information, to decide whether this is, adjectival or noun? that is is it non-kernel, in kind of a different mode or kernel? sure, absolutely, you're in the world of a noun clause. but, as far as the dative use that is the particular dat- i mean you're right it was just (the) we're addressing it from the angle of form of this. do i know by looking at this word whether i have, a a special intransitive kernel or a special linking kernel, or something else, something non-kernel? Andy?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well have we only seen so far instances where,          <FOREIGN> cui </FOREIGN>
          is used as special, as special linking? because i can't think of any instances where          <FOREIGN> cui </FOREIGN>
          could be used as, s- special in-          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i can't </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          special linking.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> special linking </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if this is </OVERLAP1>
          special        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> not without an antecedent. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> in other words it would have to refer back to some word that fell into that category of abstract nouns of helping and hindering, but as a as a relative as a relative pronoun introducing a noun clause, this really can only refer to,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          a person, or a thing in the abstract          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          as it's defined by the relative clause, so i i'd say no, that you'd have to rule out special linking. i don't think you can really rule out anything else though you need more information. d- if you get a special intransitive verb then you know, where you are. if you get, an accusative object for instance then you know you're in a non-kernel use. so you_ this you can you can rule out, special linking but we still have a wide          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          open field at this point, but that's some- i mean it's good to know that y- i shouldn't have to worry about this. does everybody understand why, you can rule out special linking, at this p-? no. okay what's the criteria Kurt as far as you understand it, for datives which occur in special linking kernels?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> there has to be_ the dative is the is the dative object so there has to be another, word a n- noun in the nominative to s- serve as the subject of the sentence. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, but there's an additional, restriction, and that is if you look on page one-sixty-five          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          in the middle of that page the s- s- s- s- se- the section entitled the special linking kernel, okay i've got, nouns, such as          <FOREIGN> auxilio (ponori) impedimento saluti </FOREIGN>
          and          <FOREIGN> usui, </FOREIGN>
          and these nouns are all generally nouns of either helping or hindering or advantage or disadvantage, so that's a restriction on the meaning of the noun. and, unless, this pronoun refers to such an idea such a noun s- elsewhere, it's not going to stand for it. in other words it won't represent that idea, and so on the basis of the meaning, or th- in this case the non-meaning of the relative, you can, eliminate that possibility. so special linking involves nouns of very particular meanings, in the dative case... okay, keep going,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          when do i have enough information Andy to decide, what use of the dative i've got does          <FOREIGN> fortuna </FOREIGN>
          help you out?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no, okay? i just know i have my subject. how about          <FOREIGN> favit? </FOREIGN>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> how does it help you out? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because it's a verb on that list. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm what list? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the list of verbs that take, um, dative, case. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, dative objects it's on the special intransitive list, so if i recognize          <FOREIGN> favit </FOREIGN>
          as being on that list, i can then, i know where i am with          <FOREIGN> cui, </FOREIGN>
          and i and i know,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          then i've, got my environment for the dative case, and then, i should know how to translate the sentence. so Andy how did you translate this thing?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, whom fortune favors has many f- he whom f- fortune favors has many friends. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm... okay.          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          questions on that anybody translate it differently...? anybody not see why that's, a correct answer it isn't the only correct answer, but it's certainly one correct answer... okay, good. sixteen-two... Mary can you read that one aloud?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i keep reading.          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          this is a word which, even, could be, a notion of helping or hindering i mean this idea of, um, poverty or neediness it's hard to rule that out so i would even keep the special linkings open. just, just because it's not, clearly an animate noun or clearly a concrete noun. how about          <FOREIGN> multa? </FOREIGN>
          is that_ do you know where you are, at that point does it help you any, in any way...? how about          <FOREIGN> desunt? </FOREIGN>
         <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          is it a special intransitive verb?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          Jim is it on that list, (of) special intransitives?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no, so, so even if i can't absolutely pin it down at this point, this isn't a linking verb so i'm not in special linking. it isn't on my special intransitive list so i'm not in special intransitive, so, i can then say even if i can't at this moment, pin down the direct use of this, i know that i have a non-kernel dative, because it doesn't fulfill the criteria for either special intransitive or special linking. so then we move into the w- the four possibilities for the environment of the dative when it is not kernel, on_ starting on page one-sixty-seven.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          dative with          <FOREIGN> est </FOREIGN>
          and its compounds. okay, does that help me...? yeah, sure it says all compounds of the verb          <FOREIGN> sum esse </FOREIGN>
          except          <FOREIGN> absum , </FOREIGN>
          set up the expectation of a dative, hence          <FOREIGN> adsum desum, </FOREIGN>
          well          <FOREIGN> desum </FOREIGN>
          that's what i've got, that something is lacking to, something or something, fails, something, so, once i find this, as part of the correct environment then i know where i am...          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          Mary as you continue to read that you see comma and then you see          <FOREIGN> avaritiae... </FOREIGN>
          what does that signal for you as you read?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> a new clause. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, okay, and what about          <FOREIGN> avaritiae? </FOREIGN>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it's dative again but, we don't know, what it is yet? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, let's think about what we've experienced and what would be probable in such a circumstance. i have an abstract singular dative, okay i've got a nominative plural noun and i have a form, of the verb          <FOREIGN> desum </FOREIGN>
          which is intransitive. then i get a comma then i get another singular dative, of an abstract noun. what am i likely to have based on what the kinds of pattern_ word order patterning that is seen in Latin?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> gapping. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. i probably have a parallel structure which involves gapping, so,          <FOREIGN> avaritiae </FOREIGN>
          is parallel to          <FOREIGN> inopiae. </FOREIGN>
          so, i can expect one or more of          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          these things, to be gapped, missing on that side. okay, so with that in mind what's the next word after,          <FOREIGN> avaritiae? </FOREIGN>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <FOREIGN> omnia. </FOREIGN>

          okay, and          <FOREIGN> omnia </FOREIGN>
          is parallel to?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <FOREIGN> multa. </FOREIGN>

          and i'm at the end of my sentence, so my gap is clearly the verb, so,          <FOREIGN> inopiae </FOREIGN>
          and          <FOREIGN> avaritiae </FOREIGN>
          have the same function. (yep.)        </U1>

          is an abstract noun, and it means poverty, or neediness. it and it does not in and of itself refer to any people. okay it's just the abstract notion. in Latin as in English, you don't often find abstract nouns in the plural. mkay, i mean that the notion of poverties doesn't, it doesn't really make much sense and it didn't make sense to the Romans either. so if you have an abstract noun, such as          <FOREIGN> inopiae </FOREIGN>
          or          <FOREIGN> sapientiae, </FOREIGN>
          or          <FOREIGN> avaritiae </FOREIGN>
          or          <FOREIGN> amicitiae, </FOREIGN>
          meaning poverty or wisdom, friendship, greed. these things are more likely on the basis of their meaning, to be singular than plural. it's not theoretically impossible, but it's really unlikely. so, these possibilities, move to a probability of dative singular, just because of, it's an abstract noun. so then i i for all intents and purposes, i know i have an_ a dative t- to go on with, so then i have this notion of          <EVENT DESC="WRITNG ON BOARD"></EVENT>          to or for, neediness or poverty, with respect to this abstract notion,          <FOREIGN> multa desunt, </FOREIGN>
          many things are lacking, and with respect to greed, everything, is lacking. but it's really hard in English because, lack is something that, we interpret just the other way around. that, th- i lack height, okay, whereas the Latin would say, tallness or height is lacking, with respect to me, so          <FOREIGN> desunt </FOREIGN>
          works just the other way around in English. any other questions? Mary.        </U1>

         </U2>
          this is true of all datives. you have this general... uh, it's almost as if you're putting, a limit on the truth value, of, a statement. so if i have the statement,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          many things are lacking, okay, or many things are missing, or lacking. and let's pick one slightly more concrete and easier from basic sentence sixteen-one, the city, is unfriendly. (okay) now, these are statements of fact. what the dative does is put a kind of, reference or specification, for these or limits their truth value. so it may not be true that the city is unfriendly, in all circumstances to all things and to all people, but i know,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>         <FOREIGN> poetis, </FOREIGN>
          with respect to poets as far as poets are concerned, the city is unfriendly. an- and that's really what datives do, they, they kind of limit the range, of meaningfulness or validity, of a certain statement. so with i- in this one many things are missing,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>         <FOREIGN> inopiae, </FOREIGN>
          if you're talking about poverty. with respect to poverty. as far as poverty's concerned, many things are missing. okay? now if you're talking greed          <FOREIGN> avaritiae, </FOREIGN>
          everything is lacking. so, it's a way of providing perspective. when you get into reading narratives, what, what i often find the dative, does, if you're doing a a narrative, is that it's it's almost like, you're directing a film, and at a certain point, the camera shifts to look at a situation from a certain character's viewpoint and the dative can represent that kind of viewpoint. um, that perspective from which things are seen. it's a fuzzy area and that's one reason why the dative's so hard because it isn't one of those clean adverbial categories. other questions. okay, let's um          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="UNSPECIFIED FILLED PAUSE"></EVENT>          let's skip sixteen-four, for the moment there are just too many places, too many things about this that could interfere with j- getting a handle on the dative. but look at sixteen-five, going through this same thing, Jim how would you_ could you read that one aloud?        </U1>

         </FOREIGN>
          so if i'm just describing, what i see there, okay, in          <FOREIGN> decimo (laboro) confecto </FOREIGN>
          i see an ablative noun phrase          <FOREIGN> decimo (labora,) </FOREIGN>
          with an ablative participle          <FOREIGN> confecto </FOREIGN>
          and a comma, so, i draw on all of my stored knowledge and realize i have an ablative absolute. then i see a nominative noun          <FOREIGN> Uristheus </FOREIGN>
          which is undoubtedly my subject and i see a dative noun          <FOREIGN> Herculi. </FOREIGN>
          which is the name of Hercules, so i know at this moment that i can automatically rule out special linking. because he doesn't fit, the criteria. i can also probably rule out dative with          <FOREIGN> est </FOREIGN>
          as showing possession, because it's unlikely that this sentence means, Uristheus belongs to Hercules or Hercules has Uristheus which is_ semantically it seems improbable. so i really need some more information before i can decide, whether i have special intransitive, um, or some other use of the dative case. as i continue to read to the right, as soon as i see          <FOREIGN> undecimum laborem </FOREIGN>
          , and i have an accusative, i know that i don't have a special intransitive kernel. i'm in some use of the dative which involves the transitive active kernel, and that can be_ the two most likely possibilities are gonna be ones where the verb is of giving, something to someone, or of a compound which takes an accusative object plus, the dative.
