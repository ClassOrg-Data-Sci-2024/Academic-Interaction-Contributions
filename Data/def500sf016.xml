          okay, um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          uh this dissertation is based on, um, this theoretical, claim, um, all people have their own theories about the world as, scientists do, and depending on what kind of theories they have, their judgment and behavior will be different. particularly in this dissertation, i'm arguing that people who have, unspecified interactionist theory, are rarely, surprised by contradicting event, and surprising event, and instead they will dispr- display greater hindsight bias, and i'm arguing that these will block their epistemic curiosity          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>

          could i ask a procedure question? um, should we interrupt throughout, this or how do you how do you wanna proceed?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, well normally it's just a quick, run-through but i don't if people wanna do it on a on a you know just... in this, fashion common on the fourth floor          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          that's fine too. i don't know, what do people wanna do? i mean there's nothing (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> (whatever) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean cuz there're various points of which, i think i might wanna want clarification and or comment on certain things </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay well          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> okay, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why don't you why </OVERLAP1>
          don't you do that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, including the, first five words. um, an unspecified interactionist theory naive theory. one possible interpretation of that, which in fact was the interpretation i made when i first read the um, the abstract was that there's a class of things called interactionist naive theories, and you're not gonna tell us which one it is. but now, as_ after having read it that's not what you meant. is that the case? in other words, there could be tons of interactionist naive theories. and but it's sort of a mystery, and you're not gonna tell us, you're not gonna specify, which of those theories you're talking about. but that's not what you mea- you're meaning by this term, is that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> correct? </OVERLAP1>
          okay so, maybe it's a good idea, to tell, us and, actually the reader, right off the bat what you mean by an unspecified interactionist, naive theory because i i'm not sure that that's general kno-          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> alright </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> general knowledge. is that the case? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> um, no i i don't think </OVERLAP1>
          it's general knowledge. so i, have three examples of unspecified in- interaction theory. so, first of all uh people can have, what i call interaction the- theory about their self. for example they can believe, at times, you are extroverted, affable sociable, while at o- at other times you are introverted, wary and reserved. now this is interactional, uh to me because, um, it has, two, opposite, states, at the same time so being introverted and being extroverted, but it does not specify under which con- exactly under which condition, you are introverted and under which condition you are extroverted. you just have two, contradicting state in your theory, without any s- further specification. now people can have also, theory, interactionist theory about behavior, so, saying that even an honest person will behave dishonestly depending on situation, so... you you behave_ you can behave honestly or dishonestly depending on situation so it is interactional, but there is no specification, under which condition you will behave honestly, or dishonestly. in the more general level... um... you can believe, the world is both the yin and yang, so without any specification, the Taoism, says that the world is, uh, world consists of the yin and yang principle. it can be yin and yang or both. so, in that sentence, uh, i defined, interactionism. unspecified interactionism... s- so?        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i i i guess it's just a matter of of presentation i mean, i- it would seem to me that in situations, where you are in effect, inventing a term, it might, make more sense, to start out right at the very beginning, th- saying what it is you mean,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          then get into the content          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          whereas is- it's actually, done almost in reverse        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> okay um, the, Hou Fun Ma another, student here, now in Stanford, used dialectical reasoning. meaning the same thing, as i do.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so he call it dialectical reasoning coined the term, but i use interactionism so, for your understanding you can equate interactionism, with dialectical reasoning. okay? now to test this claim i i compared Koreans, who are known to be more interactionist, with Americans whose theory is less interactional. um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so the dissertation, is organized in the following way. in chapter one, i provided a literature review indicating that Koreans and other A- East Asians as well indeed, more interactionist so they have more interactionist beliefs of self, and behavior. so typically their, uh self-descriptions were contextualized. implying that, their self, can be different, depending on the situation. and their causal theory emphasized an interaction between the person and the situation. and given this literature review, chapter two reported, report two studies, um, bad Samaritan study and busy Levite study. as you recall, in both studies, uh Korean subjects, were less surprised by a contradicting event, so in, study one, uh this is just one, figure, from the four figures for study one, this is probability judgment, so when the target person, who was a very religious person, did not help the, victim, Koreans showed, greater hindsight bias as indicated, the decrease, uh in probability estimate. in study two, when, less helpful person, did help another person, which should be contradicting to their, initial expectation, Koreans again expressed_ displayed greater hindsight bias, as indicated, um, in the increase of their probability estimate. and interestingly when the target person did not help, they also displayed hindsight bias so, regardless of whether the target person helped, or did not help, they displayed hindsight bias. and this pattern, uh, is quite consistent with the claim that, uh, Koreans', interactionist epistemology is blind to contradiction. so in chapter three, i reported two, other studies, study three N-S-F decision study, study four liar liar study. so in both studies, i tried to create condition, where, people should feel a sense of contradiction... however as, expected, Koreans were not surprised by this condition, where they should feel a sense of contradiction, so here, only Americans were more surprised, in th- by the presence of strong alternative hypothesis, but not Koreans. and also in study four, Americans were more surprised, and they found, a particular finding more interesting, but not Koreans... okay? in the final chapter, i discussed some implications of these findings on, development of science, and conviction and debate. my general point was that, to do science successfully, in a culture, requires a particular way of thinking style, where, uh, possessing and expressing one's conviction, through debate i- should be personally, freely allowed. and at the very end, i tried to make sure that my dissertation is not making one culture look better than the other, so i tried to, um say that, uh sometimes this argument culture of America, may have some cost. and this, the lack of argument in Asian culture may have some benefit... okay? thas- that's the dissertation.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> to_ on the last point i would've, um said that allowing, science, um allowing conviction and debate isn't enough you need to encourage it if you want, things to happen allowing is a fairly, it's almost a negative word you allow something. (uh) mo- many people will not, do something if it's merely allowed. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="GER"> but, i was under the im- oh i was also a bit surprised about the wording. because it seems that, i mean even encouraging debate, um, would not necessarily get you, to scientific, enterprises i mean you have to develop some consensus on how you're going about, accepting things as evidence and so on, which...          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          seems to go far beyond, i mean it's a a taste of you know, i mean as long as people debate and are surprised and curious everything's fine and you make great discoveries.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> c- certainly only necessary conditions, far from          <OVERLAP1> sufficient </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="GER">         <OVERLAP1> absolutely yes </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> i i'm still curious why, um, you wanted to do the, thing you brought up just at the end about uh making, different cultures look, equally good since it didn't have anything to do with your thesis. i mean as far as i can tell. i i don't understand the connection, uh there and i wondered why          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you wanted to, um do that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> a little cultural difference here between our field and your field          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          in terms          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well </U2>
          of politics        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay if that's the answer </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually i thought you did          <OVERLAP1> an outs- an outstanding job with that  </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="GER">         <OVERLAP1> every cultural psychologist has to </OVERLAP1>
          throw in a few disclaimers for all i can tell (by now)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i mean it's, i mean the first two chapters i thought were masterful in that respect, um... i mean it is a fact of life. you know in a in a situation where you compare cultures and people are very sensitive about, this type of issue </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well until the last paragraph of the thesis it never occurred to me that one was better than another, then suddenly he, pointed out to me that, the whole thesis had implied one was better than another, and um and i thought that was interesting.          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          so it seemed to me, two things that are different, i don't see why one ha- pointing out things are different is interesting intellectually and um can be documented but better is a funny... concept          <OVERLAP1> if you don't want </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> what what what were </OVERLAP1>
          the sentences i'd be interested to_ it would be nice if you could avoid that i mean just        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> well if if you want smooth relations among people, then a culture, um that, does that better may not do science well but, but that's a separate value judgment which you prefer and if you wanna do science well, you probably just can't have smooth relations among, people to the extent you can in uh, in an interactionist culture. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> but he does start with a very strong normative, claim you know and that is the set of descriptive, results of a very strong normative claim and then there's this thing called the fundamental attribution error, and Asians are not as susceptible to it, so there is a strong_ (that is          <OVERLAP1> claimed very early on) </OVERLAP1>

          i mean i i was amused because, i thought gee it's the same figure of argumentation that you find in the aging literature, where i mean basically you document you know, memory loss lang- i mean i mean document loss loss loss loss loss. so at the end of that, somehow you feel even though the data say you know, it goes downhill pretty early and it s- accelerates later on, uh you can't really say that so then you have to throw in something where it says, gain related with aging... and, and then Baltes is is uh the thing that saves you because he claims that wisdom increases, but i'm relatively sure that if i had to construct a situation, in which i make an undergraduate wise, if i give this kid, a a conflict situation, you know where you have two reasonably plausible solutions, and i put him under heavy load, heavy cognitive load, and some time pressure then i would get a wise response, because your best response when you don't care enough to work it through or you can't work it through you say it- it's kind of both plausible kind of depends you know it could be this could be that kind of depends, now then that's a low effort, no cognitive, input,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>

          uh um i can't really articulate, quite well what i'm, you know what i'm after but there seems something, when i ask myself, well i mean, what do we know about surprise and when would you be surprised and i mean the way, it sounds, in your piece is, that i need an explicit theory, uh that has spelled out, predictions and links between variables to be surprised. uh, i'm not sure i really believe that it seems to me, that, i often find things surprising even though i couldn't_ surprising or not surprising, even though i couldn't have, you know probably, got the predictions right or, wrong. and it reminded me of the discussion in, let's say Karneman and Miller's norm theory where the assumption is, very much like i mean, for for comparison judgments, that you often compute the standard,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">           <OVERLAP2> after, right </OVERLAP2>

          to deal with them, yeah, you know it's just it's not surprising cuz you don't have a theory yet in which you're supposed to be able, to include it, and and then eventually you get to that stage and then, you realize that it doesn't fit, as the theory developed and then it can lead to a whole new, set of things        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but what about this i mean, how do folks, deal with this question of what the whole point is of having a theory? i mean, why not j- simply exist i mean why do you need a theory? </U1>

          uh well natural scientists i guess, um, i think it's equally true of biologists um, or, or molecular biologists (i guess,) evolutionary biologists yeah i mean it's, natural science i think, what you wanna do is understand stuff and you just work your way, along and that's the whole point of doing it. so, there is no other reason, uh        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright th- that might actually get to an even more fundamental issue which i'd be interested in hearing your your thoughts about, which is, in day-to-day life what actually is the point, of even considering questions like this i mean so,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          why would you even need to worry about stuff like that? uh, i mean to get back to Gordon's thing. you know i just go to work every day work in a factory and go back home. why the hell do i need a theory? i mean in order to do that. so, these issues would never arise. i mean so what kind of a society, would even think that you'd need to have stuff like, physical theories, about which you could become surprised?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> w- well i don't think, everyday-life theory is articulated as, theory in physics i mean the simplistic people have, their, theories but they_ sometimes they don't, realize they do have theory. so, i don't think many people are bothered to have their own theory explicitly... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay well, let me ask a related question. could the real core here the core at issue here, have to do with expectations, i mean so, intuitively it seems to me that, you are surprised, when something, turns out to be inconsistent, with your expectations. uh, how does that idea, reconcile, with the work you're talking about here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> um, that's, for example in study, one then two, both cultures expected that in study one the target person would help the victim. when the target person did not help, which should be surprising right?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          the Koreans were not surprised. so i think expectation_ sometimes expectation, can be a priori, but sometime it can be constructed after the fact...          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          that- that's the uh...          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright </U2>
          that's the_ i think that's the hindsight bias right? they          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          they they act, as if they have expected, things turn out to be this way not that way, so they change their, expectation, after the fact        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> is there any possibility that, one part of the difference might be, how firmly held the expectation is? say in the ambiguity sense? </U1>

          if you have this complex, theory and you cannot make a commitment, you are not, determined to do anything, so it takes longer time to make commitment, it takes more information to make a judgment. i think i think that might be the case.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah remember it actually is a technical term, i mean, to be distinguished from probability. so one loose way that is sometimes interpreted, is that it's almost like probabilities about probabilities, so that normal probabilities that you would talk about as discussed in this thesis, would be sometimes referred to as first order, probabilities, and then you can talk about, things like the distributions, over those probabilities,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          uh is it conceivable that in this context what you're really dealing with, is that those second order distributions, are different          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>

       <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> suppose that in the Bayesian sense,          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you didn't just ask people, what they think is gonna happen, but instead you said put your money where your mouth is. would you expect, that people's expectations, would turn out to be the same? so in other words if you were to infer, what they really anticipated, on the basis of their actions, would you, for instance in your experiments, would you expect, that you would in fact get identical expectations as you did? as you did here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uhuh. i'm i'm lost. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. there, are in general two different ways, that you can, go about assessing what people expect to happen.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> mhm </U2>
          one is the way you did it just flat out ask 'em.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          the_ another way that you can do it, which is closer to the spirit of Bayesianism, you don't ask people anything. you, have them decide, on the basis of their beliefs and you infer what their beliefs were, from their actions. so is it conceivable, that from that point of view, the Asians were in fact more wishy-washy, in their expectations in the sense that they would not have been, as willing, to bet          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> uhuh </U2>
          uh as extremely as the Americans do? would you expect that to be the case...? sort of consistent with the spirit of your interpretations of Jeffrey's experiments, you know sorta like people regress, they you know, they don't really expect much of anything. you know they they you know it's almost like free-lancing they're, gonna, just react to things as they occur        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> well i hope that's that's the case. i expect that would be the case </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> o- on the f- face of it, it seems to me that um, if you have, Americans with, simple-minded models of the world, uh and Asians with complicated models of the world, and then you ask, people for predictions, Americans oughta be more confident. because, not as many, alternatives are being considered. uh, and yet, we know, that, it seems to be at least with respect to some things that Chinese are more, overconfident, than Americans. so how would you put those? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i think that's why, Joe and i think that we needed to distinguish, confidence from, uncertainty... so in, uh, overconfidence, is a measure of confidence. (just) i think it's a statistical term (it's) a technical term not an everyday life term. right is overconfidence </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah well yeah there is a specific way you measure it i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right so </U2>
          we hope that it's not independent of the everyday (thinking)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i think the um, conviction is everyday life term and i think that conviction is, is maybe more, reliable indicator of behavior than, overconfidence... so, i mean that's why, i put discussion about, Joe's work abo- about overconfidence and, um, my thinking about conviction. that's a_ uh it seems like Asians are less convinced, have, less conviction, yet they have e- at least equal level of confidence in terms of a probability. so unless i think a w- unless we solve that, problem, um, i mean they will just, continuing, confusion, confusion about, that word and this (word) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay but, suppose i'm a reviewer, and you make this proposal about this conviction thing, suppose i say well jeez, it's just a word, conviction, i mean, can you, in effect operationally define conviction? i mean, so i would like to see like if i'm a really serious Bayesian type of guy, i really want you to put your money where your mouth is, i mean how can i know that somebody's really, convinced? rather than just says that he's convinced? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> and this seems to be especially problematic since you're cutting across languages </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right, Bob Abelson, um, wrote something about conviction so he developed some, criteria to measure conviction          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so and, among those criteria there is behavior component          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          like how much you discuss, with your friends about that issue, how much are you trying to convince, others? i mean there there is i mean there is behavioral component and, you know emotional component so, i think we can measure conviction, in in that way        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> why would you not take the Bayesian tack? which is, put your money where your mouth is. so,          <EVENT WHO="SU-1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          give you some options if you really think this is gonna happen, then you choose A, if you don't you choose B why not take that that approach?        </U1>

          so i mean he's got three qualitatively different kinds of experiments here and, um, it would just be nice if he could, you know give the three sentences to why, (i don't know) six sentences to why these three experiments all fall out of the same basic proposition. the experiments, are as far as i can tell number one, that, behavior that wouldn't have been predicted, is not as surprising to Asians, as it is to Americans. secondly that, hypothesis, confirmation is not more surprising, when an alternative was possible or at least salable, uh than when the alternative wasn't possible or salable in other words there's something there about contradiction or potential contradiction. that's, doesn't seem to impress Asians as much, and, third that, uh, contradiction of a belief just doesn't seem to produce surprise so you make people believe something and you, ask 'em what they think of that and they tell you and then, you say oh guess what, um, the opposite of that is correct and, and uh, and they_ it just doesn't seem to intr- in- induce surprise, in Asians so, how can, how can you put, those, drive all three of those things from the same, core notion?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i mean, i was surprised that um, you, do not see the connection.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          that was, that was          <OVERLAP1> funny </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yes, </OVERLAP1>
          we've been talking about the aging problem          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> (actually) to me,          <OVERLAP1> to me </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's obvious </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> so he, so he's obvious- he's obviously not Korean </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="GER"> doesn't have a good interactionist theory </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> um, um, my_ okay here is my, answer um, if you have a interaction theory, then, you don't see a contradiction as contradiction. so you would not be surprised by surprising and contradicting          <OVERLAP1> event </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> wait wait </OVERLAP1>
          one second (hm) and you don't see contradiction as a contradiction? well that doesn't, i don't see that that follows          <OVERLAP1> (what) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="GER">         <OVERLAP1> everything </OVERLAP1>
          depends        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay everything depends right. i thou- if you've got an interactionist theory then everything depends but, if everything depends, then it's harder to see a contradiction          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          yeah okay okay then          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          and these are all about contradiction, all of these studies, are contradiction studies right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> yeah i think so yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> clearly the third one is. flat contradiction doesn't make something more surprising than if it hadn't been contradictory... um, people don't seem to see that, the hypothesis that was confirmed and the hypothesis, that was not confirmed are suf- sufficiently different then you should be more surprised, than if we didn't know about that competing hypothesis which also seems (a failure to,) recognition, contradiction, and, how is the first then how is that an instance of, failure to recognize contradiction? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> because, for example in study one they expected, that the target person would help, and in fact, he did not help. so that should be taken as a contradiction </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so it's an implicit </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> implicit contra-          <OVERLAP1> yes right, so study </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> implicit contradiction okay you may wanna </OVERLAP1>
          use that term of im- implicit contradiction and say okay now i'm gonna get really explicit, in fact as you go from one to two to three, you are making the explicitness of the contradiction          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          e- ever greater          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right so </U2>
          and that would be a nice organizing theme is just you know a sentence or two per, in length. that's an implicit contradiction that this, apparently warm guy you know, kind person did this unkind thing, still more explicit is, you have two alternative possibilities versus only the one          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          and literally completely explicit          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> right </U2>
          is, A is the case and then you say actually, not A is the case...          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          alrighty        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
