       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right plasmids remember </OVERLAP1>

          okay? so it's goes_ it starts from D-N-A to R-N-A, to proteins.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay uh a D-N-A virus yeah it, um, inserts D-N-A, as its material of... um replication.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? and then, um it'll go on to to um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but it it goes on to make proteins as well </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and transposons are sort of mysterious or what? </U1>

          well uh the one of them is where D-N-A material is being inserted into the, genome, and then um, it can stay dormant, for a while, which means that it never it_ gets expressed, for a long time after several like replications of the cell. so like, this virus, is being replicated along with the rest of the genome as it, you know what i mean like when the cell divides, and forms two, and then, something in the external environment, signals, the cell_ signals that virus to like, start like, producing its own vi- like taking over the cell and like producing its own virus and things like that.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          so like, that's when i_ that's what immediately what i think of when you say like, it jumps from one part of the of the genome to the other part of the genome.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          do you know what i mean? like, that i- maybe it's a sort of like maybe he's like indirectly talking about um, like the lysogenic versus lytic cycle. do you know what i'm saying? like it          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i thought </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but isn't lytic and lysogenic just whether, it dies or not? whether the cell's destroyed after </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. because, in in one condition in one case like, the cell that's gets infected, will explode and like, whatever. right? but like, in another case it could be two or three cells that, after several replications that it does that. </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> genome </OVERLAP1>
          right? and like what i'm saying is that like, during one of th- either the lytic or the lysogenic cycle, either like, one of the cycles when it um D-N-A's inserted is inserted, the cell automatically dies. right? it          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> automatically </OVERLAP1>
          jumps to the viru- virus attacks the cell, makes a cell, produces the virus and like the protein coat and explodes right? but in the other cycle what can what it can do is it can in- insert that information, that information can go into the genome, right? and like the cell will_ like the virus will stay dormant. af- and the um, D-N-A may or may not be replicated during the          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oops </OVERLAP2>

          this is, let's say it's just a bacteria it has circular D-N-A or whatever right okay it's got that D-N-A. and then, somehow like some virus gets inserted inside, and its D-N-A's like that. okay? and like, in one cycle this D-N-A may take the cell, and like, make more of this D-N-A. you know what i mean like make more of this D-N-A.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and, then it'll like, burst. you know what i mean like normal. right? this is like mo- th- th- this is like the case that you guys have been learning like, it like infects the cell, takes over the cell, the cell bursts and like, releases this thing.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          virus right? and that's how the virus grows. another case like what it could happen is that the cell, this like viral D-N-A can like insert inself itself into the regular D-N-A. okay? and like when this cell divides, it's gonna form... two of these. right? and like this viral D-N-A still hasn't, like done what it's supposed to do yet. do you know what i mean? like it's still in the genome. it can maybe move round maybe_ you know what i mean? like st- but it's still in the genome. it hasn't been expressed yet. so after like maybe one cycle two cycles, whenever the conditions are right for that cy- virus to like replicate or like, be activated, those genes to be activated, that cell would g- go into here.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you mean this'll          <OVERLAP1> lead </OVERLAP1>

          that it's innate and that sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't you know what i mean like, breast cancer for ex- instance you know what i mean that could caused by some sort of, transposon virus that was like, implanted in like, half of women like,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

          it can't it doesn't have a protein, outer coat. so like in your body, you don't find like,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> random transposons </OVERLAP2>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it needs an outer coat (on it) to infect something? </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> so then, </OVERLAP1>
          why does it even need the protein?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it doesn't. that's what she's saying is that like long long time ago right? some virus was created. right? and, long long time ago this virus infected a cell. okay? and, somehow maybe it didn't have the correct D-N-A. right? it didn't have the part of the D-N-A that coded for the protein coat.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so therefore the D-N-A couldn't reproduce and couldn't ex- like be encapsulated in the protein and like explode out. do you know what i mean cuz like, do you see what i_ remember like, um the step before this is like this this and then like this is the picture i remember it was like some like weird shape with          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          like flags right? and it's got like D-N-A inside. right? and then it like inserts this D-N-A into the cell. but this outside is a protein coat.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. no i know i get that so it doesn't have a protein coat but you're saying that it's already in the cell, so, why does it need a          <OVERLAP1> prot- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          it's in the genome but it's not like the v- the virus usually just goes in it doesn't like become part of the genome right?          <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's never, </OVERLAP1>
          the virus is also always like an external D-N-A thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's not          <OVERLAP1> really part of the nucleus or anything. </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> itself </OVERLAP1>
          and then it leaves. it's not like taking over it's like joining in the circle ever.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but like this one is in the circle. it's not like floating around the cell like          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> those </OVERLAP1>
          over there.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i also think that even though you didn't talk about the lytic and lysogenic cycles that, sometimes it can still insert into the the D-N-A but i don't          <OVERLAP1> think you need to know that. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so what cycle would that be </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          it's it's like this. right? except it never has this part it's al- the cell always looks like this.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and it just k- it keeps going like that through centuries and centuries and centuries and you may have some sort of          <OVERLAP1> transposon </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that would be the </OVERLAP1>

          you know what i mean like, very like early life forms where like,        </U1>

          i mean it's still being replicated in like bacteria and stuff but like there's still a plasmid that's not being replicated and that's like, being shoved from one to the other. you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> know </OVERLAP1>
          what i'm saying? so like, i feel like this doesn't affect higher life forms but it's something_ i i think that you just pretty much need to know that like,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          it goes from place to place like, know the example of um, bacteria where like it can go from a plasmid to like the genome genome to plasmid          <OVERLAP1> you know what i mean and that's how it gets t- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but when he said like, it says here </OVERLAP1>
          that it can bring genes from the uh, plasmid, to like a different location on a different plasmid. how you can (move) genes with it or something. it seems kinda strange but,          <OVERLAP1></OVERLAP1>

          um, after that like your segments are like put on that like thing where there's a plus and minus          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          like the larger fragments go this way and like smaller fragments go this way.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> which i </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, okay. i think it's_ </OVERLAP1>
          isn't it like when you like learn it in physics it's always from negative charge to positive charge?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you think that,            <OVERLAP2> positive (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right so like neg- </OVERLAP1>
          so it's always          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> didn't know that </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like, </OVERLAP1>
          it's gonna be like a negative and then a positive and it's gonna run toward that positive. right is that right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i think that </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> charge goes from like the negative to positive side. i think that's how          <OVERLAP1> it is. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so the </OVERLAP1>
          shorter more positive,          <OVERLAP1> fragments (are towards that) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> is gonna be towards more the positive </OVERLAP1>
          side and          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> then, </OVERLAP1>
          right. and i think that'll pretty much tell you what side it started from, like, when you draw the_ when they draw the pictures, they'll have like, the ink wells where or like the wells where they loaded it, you know what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          that's the side that it started from. so everything on like_ and then this is where it ends. right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so like </OVERLAP1>
          here are the bigger fragments, and those are the smaller          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> fragments. </OVERLAP1>
          you see what i'm saying? um, and then okay so then they run it out, and you get like these big fragments over here longer fragments this way you know things like that.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but my D-N-A is different than your D-N-A. so,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> you can d- detect differences by seeing the different </OVERLAP1>

          and so, like if like let's say, there was a crime, okay          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and like,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>

          if i if i was like, if i was like the whatever the, i don't know if i was guilty right? then my D-N-A would match the D-N-A,        </U1>

          if you guys found this because i didn't see it in the reading S-S-L-Ps, as opposed to R-F-L-Ps?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i think those are just like more like, if there's an insertion or deletion it's going to be shorter or longer you can detect it when when you do P-C-R, you're gonna get like replications of uh the chromosomes, so say you have like an insertion in yours that i don't have yours are going to be longer than mine, and that would be detected in P-C-R. or yours would be shorter if you had a deletion. i think it just does (like)          <OVERLAP1> the length </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> isn't P-C-R </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but why but you're not </OVERLAP1>
          detecting anything with P-C-R... that's just a way to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but i'm saying that l- you produce 'em in there, and it says detected by P-C-R, that's what he said in class i think didn't he? or what what did you put down          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>

          it'll be made obvious by P-C-R        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's just kind of what i          <OVERLAP1> got out </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> detected by P-C-R </OVERLAP1>
          is what i've          <OVERLAP1> got. yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i just </OVERLAP1>
          kind of think it would be by P-C-R because yours would be longer than mine so when it went_ when we did P-C-R on it you'd end up like, your_ longer fragments than i would mine would be shorter.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so maybe what she's saying is that like yeah you have detected by P-C-R caused by insertions or deletions. okay so pretty much what she's saying is that like you don't p- okay you put your um, D-N-A into, P-C-R to get replicated se- several times          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in order </OVERLAP1>
          for like any of the se- any of these things to be like put on it right? like you want several copies of your genome.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm. okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> does that help? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so you make several copies of the genome. let's say that Diana has like insertion of like nine and_ nine like, amino acids or something like that in hers.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          or no- not amino acids like nucleic acids.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          in her like genome. and you have like a deletion of like twenty-nine. you know what i mean          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so like </OVERLAP1>
          her's are gonna be longer, and yours are gonna be shorter. do you know what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so there's no restriction enzymes that's actually going to be put into it. so like the way they would detect it is, that you put your d- put both of your D-N-As into P-C-R.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and then um, you run 'em along the gel.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay like difference between here is that they would actually put in a restriction enzyme before you b- run it on the gel, to look at the length. and so there was actually going to be two only one band. your band, and her band. when you run it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah there's just gonna be two, we're gonna run our whole thing. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah you don't cut it up you don't do anything with it </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> in in S-S-L-P you don't cut it up? </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you're just comparing </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right cuz our D-N-A is gonna be different length because it might have deletions or something and i might have insertions.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> or </OVERLAP2>

          you see what i'm saying like          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>

          you know what i mean like if and her chromosome you wouldn't be able to see it. but masses of your chromosome you're gonna sh- is gonna show as a big dark band. and masses of her chromosome's          <OVERLAP1> gonna show us </OVERLAP1>

          and so that's why tha- it shows up, it's detected, by P-C-R. it's not really being detected it's just,          <OVERLAP1> it's innate like </OVERLAP1>

          you need like, if you_ i don't know_ think about the size of your chromosome i mean like, frigging like, a- like skin particles that fall off my skin have like millions of c- of cells in them.          <EVENT WHO="S4" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          like how are you gonna see that on a like          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that true </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> as a </OVERLAP1>
          big dark band on like, you know what i mean like some gel          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> need </OVERLAP1>

          so like... i think you need P-C-R for all D-N-A identification like,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's just strange that he'd like point it out like as this          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          this one he says detected by gel electrophoresis and (this one he go-) this one's detected by P-C-R. like that's the difference between them.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like aren't you_ don't you have to use gel electrophoresis for, S-S-L-Ps too?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i think </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> about </OVERLAP1>
          it cuz he just kinda said like this one's detected by P-C-R i think i- just as long as you know which is detected by what and get the general idea of what they're detecting, i don't think it's gonna be like a short answer or or like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>

          like what do you mean by detected by P-C-R?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, for the, experiment, i don't know this is kinda like, i guess a lecture behind this one but why is it on the plates, you have that like antibiotic resistance or something you know when you like spreading around like i don't understand that part of it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. um </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (in like) </OVERLAP1>
          the plasmid and then there's like i don't understand what that all_ like why do you need, the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> because the_ you only wanna like_ you're only examining the bacteria that like, might have the, insertion of the restriction (i mean,) or          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> of the </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the fragment </OVERLAP1>
          you know how          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          you're inserting fragments so you only wanna look at like the specific plasmids that might have taken it, and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> those </OVERLAP1>
          are have the like amp resistance in them,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so anything else that's in there that does- that's not amp resistant'll just die.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's why you put the </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>
          all that shows up is what you're examinining.          <OVERLAP1> examinining? examining. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so those are like really (like) colonies </OVERLAP1>

          are different. see okay there's two different things right. but there's plasmids. you have a normal plasmid,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you </OVERLAP1>
          cut it with a restriction enzyme to add your fragment in there. okay?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so your plasmid originally has ampicill- ampicillin resistance.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
          and your fragment tell- like, gives you blue and whatever          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> white </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> white </OVERLAP1>
         <OVERLAP1> colonies </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          okay? so, there's two checks. one check is to make sure that you have a plasmid in there. th- so and that's ampicill- ampicillin resistant. that plasmid may or may not have that fragment inserted inside.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but it'll still be amp          <OVERLAP1> resistant, (if) it's just out. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i- but it'll still be amp re- resistant </OVERLAP1>
          right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> as </OVERLAP1>
          long as          <OVERLAP1> plasmid is there. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> as long as the </OVERLAP1>
          plasmid got into the cell. okay? so then you like, do this to your sample and you get samples that are ampicillin resistant that grow on the on that petri dish.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          okay so now you know that those cells have your um, plasmid in it. but you don't know if all those plasmids have that fragment in there.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? so then you put it on some other, like gel, and it gives a color, or someth- like, i don't know          <OVERLAP1> what exactly gives it </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (no) you grow it on the </OVERLAP1>
          ampicillin, on the ampicillin re-          <OVERLAP1> resistant </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> resistant </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it </OVERLAP1>
          has some sort of color to it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? and then, you know that either either your blue colonies you want or's your white colonies you want right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so like now, now you know that your plasmid, those colonies have both your plasmid in it and that fragment that you want.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so the </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> i don't know like </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> remember, </OVERLAP1>
          someone explained it to me that in um, like in prokaryotes you know how, they don't have D-N- like splicing,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          of introns cuz they don't have enough stuff to do it?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so if you just injected normal D-N-A, it encodes for introns as well as exons.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you need something that's not gonna have the introns and M-R_ once M-R-N-A is made it doesn't_ it like the introns are already spliced out. so if you use R, reverse transcriptinase or          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whatever, </OVERLAP1>
          it's making D-N-A off of R-N-A and R-N-A isn't gonna code for introns if they were already spliced out.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

          okay? problem is like, like we can't find insulin for diabetic people, we need to mass produce insulin. okay? so what they did was, and you can't just take that, you can't just can't take the D-N-A from a human being. right? the part of the human genome that's that um, these these diabetic people are missing, and like just like, put that in some p- just type of bacteria make it produce insulin. because it has introns and extrons.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          right? does that make sense?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i think so. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but why are you putting into bacteria to begin with? just to replicate it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> to, well okay um, like, number one like when you like_ gene therapy. reason why gene therapy doesn't work. right? you like insert some D-N-A into your cells, you don't even know like just like this case right here, you don't know if your cell's gonna take up w- take up like, the D-N-A          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or not. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          also like, D-N-A when it once it gets into the body like it's, considered external D-N-A. right? and it it'll work for like a couple replications but after that like, it's gonna attack it and like it's gonna attack that D-N-A and it's gonna like send it right out. you know what i mean like it's          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not </OVERLAP1>
          gonna be_ it's not a pro- it's not like a, a prolonged like um prevention of like diabetes or like treatment you know what i mean it can't be the treatment.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
          so what they're saying is that like why don't we just inject insulin into these people, for diabetic people right? like insulin that they don't produce by themselves that we produce elsewhere, you know what i mean so that we can like cure their like, you know like sugar lows and highs and things like that. okay? so like one way of doing this is that like, i remember one way is like you can, get insulin from pigs.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you know what i mean like purify the insulin that's in pig's blood and give it to people. and that works sometimes. but another way_ but like, okay like you're killing all these pigs just for insulin right? but they_ another way that they can do it is through this process of like making these bacteria produce, like, insulin or make rats produce insulin like extra amounts of insulin.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh,            <OVERLAP2> so you </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> do you </OVERLAP1>
          see what i'm saying like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so the bacteria just does it          <OVERLAP1> you don't have to, take it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> exactly like the bac- </OVERLAP1>
          just in this case right? like for like for instance like, we wanna take our recombinant D-N-A right here codes for insulin.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay, and we wanna insert it into this bacteria, so this bacteria        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> will be_ mass-produce it </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it'll just be ins- it'll just be a plasmid inside the bacteria producing its stuff and sending it out </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> just like yeah it's just like a virus it'll mass produce that, exactly like, exactly. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> then you can extract it from bacteria and then use it for </OVERLAP1>

          a virus takes over what the, original cell does and pr- does what it wants. right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so like, </OVERLAP1>
          what we're doing it manipulating that virus to produce something that's positive and not negative.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>

          then when you, cuz like i know it was one of the questions says like why do you use retroviruses in          <OVERLAP1> humans? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh yeah </OVERLAP1>
          the human gene therapy using defective retroviruses, is that what you're talking about? in the question?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right because in order you wanted to use retroviruses because okay remember you have, different types of um, infection of of viruses like D-N-A virus, R-N-A virus, like things like that.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? okay um, D-N-A virus. why can't we use just the D-N-A of insulin that's encoded in your body right now and put it into a cell and make it produce          <OVERLAP1> insulin? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          see that's what_ cuz i- the, our cells have stuff to like_ why do you need to use a retrovirus to do that? cuz          <OVERLAP1> our cells can </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah because we're putting </OVERLAP1>
          it into a a we're putting it into a prokaryotic, place. not a eukaryotic place.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right but in our body </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> couldn't we just put it in our cells? </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why </OVERLAP1>
          do we have to have retroviruses in us if we have eukaryotic cells?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't think that like... i don't think that that's the necessarily like the correct way to think of it because sometimes, your D-N-A doesn't, like, your D-N-A sometimes doesn't get put directly into your genome, it may be something that's just floating out that's like, it h- i think it also has to do with context with the question.          <OVERLAP1> what exactly </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like okay </OVERLAP1>
          it says how is a retrovirus used in hu- in human gene therapy? and it's used as a vector to introduce D-N-A into human cells. but, like can't you just use a D-N-A virus to introduce, D-N-A into human cells too? like why does it have to be a retrovirus?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>

          just says something about_ and it it was an example of gene therapy, and it says you insert a normal allele into the retrovirus vector, let the retrovirus infect bone marrow cells and viral D-N-A carrying normal alleles inserts into the chromosome.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i think that </OVERLAP2>

          right? okay so then, the thing is that like, okay we make this like nice R-N-A molecule in your in your nucleus, it has to be transported out, right? so it needs to have introns and extrons right? like this like the cell won't recognize it as being like foreign D-N-A that doesn't need to, splice out introns and extrons and things like that. so maybe i splice out like, necessary information that like this protein that this um, protein coat needs in order to form. do you see what i'm saying          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like, </OVERLAP1>
          if we want to think about it so technically we don't even have the right answers to answer these questions.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i think that            <OVERLAP2> we </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> do you </OVERLAP1>
          see what i'm saying?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah i think we're (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like i think that he was </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so just </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> pretty much </OVERLAP1>
          just trying to get you to          <OVERLAP1> regurgitate the fact that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> to look at an example, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          that hu- human gene therapy uses defective          <OVERLAP1> retroviruses. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          does that make sense? but the other thing too that i know is that like, if you wanted to infect um, if you wanted to infect um, like bacteria cells, you know with this with the thing for like gene        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> then you that's why you would need it. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> therapy or something, you'd_ that's why you'd </OVERLAP1>
          need retroviruses        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, that's what i (was so) confused about. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> because they don't have that facility to do introns </OVERLAP1>
          and extrons.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but like...          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so            <OVERLAP2> just (a) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> one </OVERLAP1>
          way of gene therapy, is to make bacteria cells you know to produce some sort of protein that everybody needs or that some people are missing. you know what i mean and that's like the only example that i think of is, when i think of like retroviruses being used. um, i think there's another thing, there's another like, i remember saying that like retroviruses are used to_ in human genome. you know what i mean? but i think, it's the fact that like, maybe like when this when this um cell is like reproducing or when like this viral, stuff takes over, you know what i mean like maybe the cell doesn't do normally what it does. maybe the cell does normally what, viruses do, and viruses are like, are thought of as being like, like prokaryotic cell type things you know what i mean? do you do you see what i'm saying like          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> rather </OVERLAP1>
          than like the cell going through its normal process of like, let me splice this stuff out but like, the cell really w- this like virus really just wants to do is make tons and tons of copies of its own thing, it doesn't matter, w- where if it has introns and extrons because they don't have introns and extrons so like, maybe they wanna just bypass that thing,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          altogether.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i was </U2>
          do you see what i'm saying? like we don't know enough about these          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> cycles </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this like correctly. </OVERLAP1>
          but maybe he like wrote the wrong word, like maybe he just wanted to say gene therapy not gene therapy in human cells. you know what i'm saying? like          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> well </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> gene </OVERLAP1>
          therapy has a lotta definitions.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay then also cuz he like mentioned how s- how it like it... the H-I-V virus          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it's a retrovirus cuz they say in human gene therapy you use a defective retrovirus. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, what they mean by retro- defective retrovirus is that, the D-N-A or the R-N-A that it carries with it, isn't, harmful to your body it's actually helpful to          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> your body. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the word defective i was like what's wrong with it? </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so the fact that </OVERLAP1>
          H-I-V is a retrovirus, does that make it more th- is th- that's just_ does it_ could be... cuz it says like, A-Z-T_ i remember him talk- like something how like, A-Z-T inhibits reverse transcriptinase or something,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          in, okay i don't know what i'm getting at.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i don't_ the example of H-I-V all i wrote was that it, doesn't kill the cell it just uses it to reproduce and weakens your cells. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and more of it weakens your cells          <OVERLAP1> and things like that </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no he didn't like get into all that detail          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

          actually i do have a question. the um... when_ like i understand how, when like transcription is reduces or increases l- cuz li- there's like glucose or if there's in the lac one of if there's like enough tryptoph- whatever          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that doesn't </OVERLAP1>
          need like it is reduced, but when are the amounts of the repressor proteins_ (but) like are they just always there? do they ever change the amount of repressor proteins?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh that's a good question </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz i- like in this ques- i remember the question on the exam like, i knew the answer but i didn't, like their listed possibilities of,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          so like because glucose was added obviously they don't need to_ the lac operon doesn't need to be as, speedy cuz there's already glucose there so it like it doesn't need to break down the lactose as much, so the answer is lacZ gene transcription would be reduced but others possibilities are the lac repressor protein would begin to bind to the operator like is it always bound to the operator cuz it's always          <OVERLAP1> functioning? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the thing is that glucose can break down the lactose, so when the lactose is around it's like i need someone to break me down so it makes this and this stuff breaks down the lactose, and then it          <OVERLAP1> stops making it. </OVERLAP1>

          um, depending on if like, that uh, the in- it's called inducer or corepressor. and inducer means that it has to bind to it in order for it to do something,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          and the corepressor means that it needs to be there in order to like regulate it.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          do you know what i mean? so it's just two definitions. that's it. nothing          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> nothing </OVERLAP1>
          big. and inducer means that it induces it to, like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it induces the lac operat- lac operon to be transcripted right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and the repress- inhibits the          <OVERLAP1> transcription of the operon </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          it's called a corepressor because it just repress it by itself it needs that um regulatory protein, also to repress it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, you're saying that glucose is a corepressor? no wait what'd you just say is a corepressor? </U1>

          there's two things, okay one where it's always bound i- if it's like, it's always not bound. okay? it's always it's always always always_ in the tryptophan one, um, in the trip operon, that um, re- that um, the regulator, you know, that binds the operator is never there, it's_ that thing's always being expressed, that the trip operon or the trip genes are always being, are always always always being um,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          uh, whatever transcripted and then translated. right? but um... and then once like tryptophan is there,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right? tryptophan is the corepressor.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh i see </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because </OVERLAP1>
          tryptophan can't bind to the operator,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh it binds to the repress- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but the tryptophan </OVERLAP1>
          but and the regulatory thing can bind to the,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i get it </U2>
          operator.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i understand </U2>
          do you see what i'm saying?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          they're both called repressors.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and then in here, in the the lac o- the lac operon, um, it's called an inducer because, once it adds to it, it like takes it off the operon,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh i see </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and gets </OVERLAP1>
          translated.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you know what i mean so in, by adding that um allo- allolactose, right?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> by_ </OVERLAP1>

          okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          is that, pretty much what's in that um that section?          <OVERLAP1> for gene rep- </OVERLAP1>

          but in here there's like, like what you said like pretranscriptional transcriptional R-N-A level ju- like how detailed do we have to know about          <OVERLAP1> all these levels? </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> R-N-A like </OVERLAP1>
          whatever, into those categories and you need to know and be able to define what, um each regulation is.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. on that note i have a question about one of the regulations he talked about. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, at the transcriptional level he talked about, um this, and i kinda un- i un- i think i understand that but then he said that the_ because there are no operons and the genes are spread around, pathways need to be on at the same time, so the same segment in front of all those pathways needs to be on or something, it's like the last thing he said on the transcriptional level.          <OVERLAP1> i didn't understand that. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um how i understand </OVERLAP1>
          it is th- that, it's different because there aren't operons in eukaryotes they're not like grouped together all those genes,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so that </OVERLAP1>
          you've got like several different promoters in different places, but they're all gonna be activated by the same thing. right? like it's the same promoter, but it's just in front of that gene, i- where that gene is in different places? or is that, not make any sense?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> say say it again. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i guess i don't </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> what do you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> or </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          is what, what are they saying that this like activator does?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't know if they were talking about,          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          that activation complex if they're just saying        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or maybe they're talking about_ this is the way i i i kinda think (over) that, is that in like eukaryotic cells like, there's a lotta things that can affect just a production of protein, or like things like that like you m- several genes may code for like your hair color,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and several genes code for like your skin color and like things like that you know what i          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> mean? </OVERLAP1>
          like it's not just one gene, that like does it.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so therefore you need o- one thing can activate all those different genes. does that make_ is that what he was talking          <OVERLAP1> about? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> what i- </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what one </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i don't get like, </OVERLAP1>
          he's saying something like,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay let's          <OVERLAP1> let's think about it this way </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          that's two different things. right? that happen i- while you're in the sun. okay tha- at least that's what happens to me so i'm just gonna use myself as a as a case right? okay so i go in the sun, and let's say like U-V-A rays or something like that affect like, they hit my cells right? and in my skin cells it hits all the different pigments, that make um, it activates all the pigments that give me dark that give me darker pigments. okay? in my hair it gets lighter, right? so like, it activates all the things in my hair color that make it light. do you see what i'm saying? like it'll activate all of them and it's just from one U-V-A ray.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's, yeah it's like um, this activator activates one thing for an operon like in in prokaryotes,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but i- or on on on one on one strand of D-N-A or whatever right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>

          okay and also because what you were saying before is like because it's not like an operon where everything's on top of each other you just know that it still happens like even if like genes for the same things are spread out like they're all          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

          the way that_ like it's so complicated like, think about it. transcription factors right? those are proteins too. they need to be like, transcripted and translated          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          into those proteins. do you know what i mean? so like in order to get those you need to induce those. you know what i mean? in order for like this one gene to be expressed you need to express all those gen- transcription factors, all those things that like, are regulated in the transcription factors in order to just to get this gene. do you know what i mean? so like, it's so complicated and like things like that like, they don't tell you that like, that transcription factors also need to be, you know what i mean enhanced or to be like regulated. you know what i'm saying? like, cuz in order d- do you see          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i get what you're s- yeah </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> like it's a </OVERLAP1>
          big big cycle like, they just want you know that there're transcription factors affect like the expression of a gene. there're enhancers and what do the enhancers do? you know things like that like        </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          it just doesn't make sense. you know what i mean? two different species don't mate. and like, pr- that's i think that's that's pretty much it i don't think there's... and i think that what he's getting at is that like, okay remember like, um isn't it like uh, birds have um, like are like three-N or something like that? right? and like humans are like          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> two-N or, yeah </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> haploid and like you know what i mean? </OVERLAP1>
          do you know what i'm saying? like those two just can't mix because like it's a bird and a human but, you know what you know what i'm saying? like        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. oh          <OVERLAP1> i see </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh okay </OVERLAP1>
          okay okay. so he's talking a- w- when he's talking about this he's talking about like like see how this is like the the um, they're different like, this, full set of chromosomes is four and this is six.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          do you know what i mean? so like when you get here you don't you can't really pair up, so like they just all,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          they_ you know what i mean they just all like re-form together, as like a whole. and when you          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> have </OVERLAP1>
          that like_ okay, so like you have species A and you have species B.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay? and they both live on this desert deserted island.          <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay? and somehow species A meets with sp- meets_ or mates with species          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> B </OVERLAP1>
          in some like, i don't know uh like, other dimension or something like that          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> something </OVERLAP1>
          happens where          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> species </OVERLAP1>
          A can um, like mate with species B. and then you get this all of a sudden right? but you can't pair up anything          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> from here </OVERLAP1>
          to here because it doesn't_ the numbers don't fit          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
          right? so because of that let's say, and then a mitotic error, error, error happens where like, you know what i mean you don't split it up right and things like that,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right? and you just get a um, like a daughter cell that has all of them in it. so you go from like, an N of four and an N of six and now you get an N of ten because all chromosomes are in that, in that p- in that species and it forms a new species, species C.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so all these just replicated but they didn't split up they all          <OVERLAP1> just went to one cell? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah they just </OVERLAP1>
          they all went to the same          <OVERLAP1> cell. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so that's allopolyploidy? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but they split up here. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right because this species can mate with like          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it's a_ itself </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this is, it's two </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>

          species B can produce reproduce with species B to get species B. some ti- one at one time or another species A mated with species          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> B, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it </OVERLAP1>
          formed species C.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay? and species C like, um, mated with itself, to get like species B aga- or species          <OVERLAP1> C again. do you know what i'm saying? yeah. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh then they also split these up and these two mated </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah or like, </OVERLAP1>
          yeah like it has to like you can't j- you know what i          <OVERLAP1> mean? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          like an- like let's another pair of species A and a species meet uh B uh me- mate and they form another species C, now species C can mate with species Cs and still form species Cs. do you see what i mean? cuz the numbers work out right.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>

          how often do you get two species of          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
