          like, i was reading in the book. it's like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh oh,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> the </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay, </OVERLAP1>
          i just...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> for the fatty acid breakdown right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh yeah, i          <OVERLAP1> think so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          do you know what chapter that is?          <OVERLAP1> it's (way) past this </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um, in </OVERLAP1>
          alri- is it all in the same ch- it was like,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> glyoxylate? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i'm just </OVERLAP1>
          sort of confused about it, like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the purpose of it? or          <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like, </OVERLAP1>
          i i know it's like, it breaks down fatty acids but like, how is it related to like the citric acid it like feeds to the citric a- acid cycle        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, right okay, so, some of the same enzymes are involved, okay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          like, uh you go from acetyl CoA to citrate that's          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay            <OVERLAP2> yeah, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know exactly </OVERLAP1>
          what you do in the citric acid cycle so you s- have a citrate synthase that does that. okay, then you go to isocitrate, just like in the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> citric acid </OVERLAP1>
          cycle, so          <OVERLAP1> aconitase </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          what i- what does this mean? like, you know that means that if there_ A-T-P would inhibit it? or,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um, let's find out. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> is that j- like an inhibition? </OVERLAP1>
          and in calcium and A-D-P s- like,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that i- that's what it appears to be so, A-T-P would inhibit that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz i- is it cuz it bi- it binds to that, or or something? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it probably binds to the enzyme,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          isocitrate dehydrogenase          <OVERLAP1> which </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh okay </OVERLAP1>
          and it          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> changes </OVERLAP1>
          the conformation        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, so and it's it's an allosteric inhibitor.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          and so these are allosteric activators.          <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh </OVERLAP1>
          so allosteric inhibitors bind to the enzyme and change the active site? or is that,          <OVERLAP1> so oh okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, right. </OVERLAP1>
          okay?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay so, um,          <OVERLAP1> maybe </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like, </OVERLAP1>
          my book started talking about these two like how they, different parts of it give off C-O-two        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, so we have C-O-two          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so, what do you think that means?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i remember </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so how many </OVERLAP1>
          how many carbons does citrate have?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> doesn't it have six?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so it gives off two          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it g- </U2>
          isn't isn't there like two parts to it? like,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay let's look at the, structure.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> wait </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DUR=":08" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay, so here's citrate          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> ci- yeah </U2>
          okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like, i think this one's the one that leaves. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> which one's the one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the middle one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the new one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no the middle one, here          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          that's the one that, leaves first        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right... so what does that mean? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that it changes, shape? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so, this is your substrate citrase, citrate and, aconitase the enzyme,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          is gonna change it to well eventually to isocitrate,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay? and still has          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> six carbons </OVERLAP1>
          at this point, okay? then, you have this oxidative          <OVERLAP1> decarboxylation step </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh, so that car- </OVERLAP1>
          that would ca- that would cause the C-O-two to leave        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, and that's catalyzed by, this          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> enzyme </OVERLAP1>
          okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. so that was </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so then you have another carbon, leaving, sa- it's ca- like the step name is called the same oxidative decarboxylation, but it's a, by a different enzyme has          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> different </OVERLAP1>
          substrate        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay? </U2>
          how does that r- sort of relate to the, other one though?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> what other one? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the, this one          <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          well, the same enzymes and substrates are used and that, this cycle, um, okay it says, what is, it says it's a variation of the citric acid cycle right?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and          <EVENT DUR=":11" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay. hello          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hi </U2>
          oh we're being recorded today, okay? so you hafta, sign some consent forms before you can speak.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="R1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> actually if you'd rather fill them out, when you leave          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          at the end of the appointment that's okay too.        </U1>

          like, this is confusing me. you know how it's enzyme limited, and substrate limited? like, this is exactly the same as in my textbook. h- how is the, this one enzyme limited, and, how, like i'm i got confused cuz it seems the opposite for me. ma-          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay let's read the little </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i'd s- i'd say this would be </OVERLAP1>
          enzyme limited          <OVERLAP1> cuz (there's only) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> thing down here </OVERLAP1>
          okay          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          let's read this.          <SEG TYPE="READING"> regulation of the flux through a multistep pathway occurs at steps, that are enzyme limited. </SEG>
          okay?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
         <SEG TYPE="READING"> at each of these steps, the orange arrows, which are generally exergonic, the substrate is not in equilibrium with the product, because the enzyme catalyzed reaction is relatively slow. </SEG>

          so, what they're saying is, the enzyme, um, there's low concentration of the          <OVERLAP1> enzyme </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> is th- </OVERLAP1>

          i get it. okay, so, what's happening here is, B is your substrate, for          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> then what's </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> A i- it's just a multistep pathway </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh so just like          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so it's just arbitrary </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> it's just say ran- </OVERLAP1>
          oh, okay          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so they could </U2>
          so B's th- and this is enzyme limited cuz there's only one enzyme.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no, the enzyme is the ac- the arrow, okay the enzyme is here this is a product, that you get.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, okay </U2>
          okay? so          <OVERLAP1> your enzyme, is here. enzyme is here </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so enzyme limited you get one product. </OVERLAP1>
          oh the the arrows are the enzyme.          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          it's not like you just get one product, but you get, like,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you have a </OVERLAP1>
          high concentration of substrate compared to a low concentration of product. and that's why it's called enzyme limited because you don't have a lot          <OVERLAP1> of enzyme </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz you </OVERLAP1>
          let's say you had all this, substrate but there's one enzyme there, only one of these can go,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and that could make just that.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and this is substrate limited cuz there's        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you still have to make one </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you would still, make a comparable amount of product,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and then h- </OVERLAP1>
          here there's like, here's a substrate.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so here's your substrate,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> and there's many </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> for this enzyme </OVERLAP1>
          and, this, um, you don't have a lot of uh, substrate, an- but you have a lot of enzyme. so you make your product. but now this next reaction is enzyme limited so you don't have a lot of enzyme.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you have          <OVERLAP1> just like one enzyme there and (xx) </OVERLAP1>
