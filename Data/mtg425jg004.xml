          i mean please, whatever i write, you know please comment on anything that you don't agree with i think should be be          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, we hafta work on our goal, too and maybe we should do that as a group because Glenda had, the good point that it seems to presume, um, presumes that restoration, is... is a definite outcome.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          and i tried, working on it last night and i was getting nowhere.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> it's just the first sentence she doesn't like. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i- but i mean, a- she_ it's not that she doesn't a- it's not that she doesn't like what we're saying it's just how we're saying it... we've got to, sort of um... put a spin on it that is more open-ended.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um... and it's kinda hard or i was having trouble without losing the integrity of what we were saying or sounding, you know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm, yeah but (isn't it...) G- Glenda really has a problem with it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i was um let's see, what i so what i tried to do was to work from our from the problem sorta the problem statement, into a goal. and, we have a sentence in the problem statement now that says, that identifies MEANDRS' goal,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> as to improve the diversity and quality of fisheries and wildlife habitat as well as the aesthetic and recreational quality of the river, while minimizing the impacts to the riparian land noter- owners and agricultural interests. </SEG>
          and then we say in our, our objective is sort of to provide, oh, material_ you know provide stuff, to MEANDRS,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and, that MEANDRS doesn't have the resources to undertake it.          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and so i was trying to sort of combine those three things, into our goal, that we are sorta serving as, um, you know that we're gonna, you know provide this information, um, you know, to assist MEANDRS, you know in their sort of in their goal to improve, this that and, the other thing. um i don't know h- what you guys think about that, that approach.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> (i mean) i think it doesn't, it doesn't a- address that, that, Glenda's concerns.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i think,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i think what she wants uh i- is to, to more specifically say something like, in g- in nice words, that, we will be be presenting them with, a package of information, and that they could do... with it, as they please. basically.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and they can in- they can_ yeah basically i- tha- that, so, that way we're objective we're, unbiased we're, detached from the,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, </OVERLAP2>
            that's good          </U2>
          whole thing we don't, say con- uh restoration is good restoration is          <OVERLAP1> bad </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          nothing        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, i can't find something </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what are you looking for? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> something that i wrote. </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":18" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> why don't we just, why don't we just define, as our goal </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, i think one way to m- maybe make it easier is, in the, problem statement we defined, MEANDRS' objectives, and i and i think that's good. and i don't think we need to really rehash those in our goal.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, so you know maybe we can just say, given MEANDRS' goals, as stated in the, or as described in the problem, or in section, one-point-one or whatever (of) the problem statement, um... you know our, the purpose of this project is to, um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          to to explore, the option of restoring MEANDRS,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          or restore, the watershed, um... something like that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> i- i- if we just eliminate, the part of the goal, of the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> MEANDRS, </OVERLAP1>
          from here, you know...? the part of of of          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          they do, you know? i think we, we we we, have (removed) (xx.)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <OVERLAP1> so you would just </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you would just say m- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> instead of, you know to assist them.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          let's not assist them let's just, give them the thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> (you know) </OVERLAP2>

          maybe maybe not practical, but possibilities and limitations instead of pro and con        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sh- b- yeah just just throw it in there with our other words,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          we'll, (xx)        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i like limitations but i don't like possibilities          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          okay so that's evaluate pros and cons... of the changes identified in objective... three. okay. um, and objective_ in five... is to identify, changes impacts to agriculture, resulting from the rehabilitation of          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the river. </OVERLAP1>
          maybe we_          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> we should </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          should we just do including agriculture,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          up here?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, </OVERLAP1>
          i sort of a- i i sort of agree more with Pat on that than Glenda that um... i think we want to sort of identify um, agriculture,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          on its own right because of the fact that it is          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
          is, so critical i think it's sort of politically, um,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> correct </U2>
          a good move,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          to make. that we're not just looking at_ that agriculture's not just part of the ecology equation but          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's </OVERLAP1>
          its own, it's sort of its own          <OVERLAP1> factor. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's sort of_ it's got a cross over between ecology and social,          <OVERLAP1> and economics yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah and it just crosses sort of </OVERLAP1>
          almost everything.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and so you could either look at the_ Glenda's idea was she was looking at it, okay agriculture, economics are gonna affect agriculture.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          and what we wanna look at is just the whole potential for agriculture.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          not just, you know how is this gonna, um how is rehabilitation gonna affect agriculture? but just sort of, what are the poten- what is the agricultural potential, in general?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and think if we </OVERLAP1>
          explain if_ i think if we explained this if we don't just leave it as a sentence          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          they were saying to sort of fill these in you know?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          but if we fill it in and say you know we can we could we could put a qualifying statement there that this has been identified as it's own... you know as a separate objective because of the importance... you know what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          because of the          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> importance </OVERLAP1>
          to MEANDRS, the MEANDRS group and the watershed as the whole to consider the agricultural potential in the region and, and the relationship to rehabilitation.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          something like that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. that sounds good... so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think Glenda just saw it sort of floating out there,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and didn't really know          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> especial- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why </OVERLAP1>
          it was on its own.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> especially since there wasn't anything underneath it. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right.          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>          is this_ i guess its sort of a vision based on the fact that neither of them had a lotta lotta comments that this is more of the style that they would_ they tend to be they tended to be receptive to as being sort of a filled in paragraph, um          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i i </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> objective </OVERLAP1>
          form.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think so as opposed to bullets.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          um, yeah cuz they_ and they were saying something about bullets before maybe if we can just_ some of these        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> bullets_ they kind of said task circle which          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> bullets </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they didn't_ </OVERLAP1>
          and          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          objectives should be more of a paragraph.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right... okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh i i guess we should a- maybe we should fill in Hiro a little bit on,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what we talked about yesterday before you came.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh... </U2>
          one of their, one of their concerns that you          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> might </OVERLAP1>
          have seen, in reading was differentiating between the objectives,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh </U2>
          the methods and the tasks. and that the way it reads now they sort of, it's not clear the distinction even though we have them sort of in different sections they all sound the same.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          our objectives          <OVERLAP1> sound the same as our methods </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">         <OVERLAP1> yeah yeah, as </OVERLAP1>
          Glenda mentioned.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          yeah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, the way that they_ we sort of all of us, decided that the methods are more conceptual,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          i mean the ob- sorry the objectives are more conceptual,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay. </U2>
          sort of like in a paragraph,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh </U2>
          explaining you know why you wanna do this, and um, the methods are more sort of the applied process. we we to ab- to achieve this objective we will do X Y and Z.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay. </U2>
          and then the tasks they said sort of we'll sort of leave that loose for now, they're more like it will take us, this amount of time, and these sorts of things, in order to to, fulfill this method          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          so method, method one might be to collect historical          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> information. </OVERLAP1>
          okay so that might be a method.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          then the task will be go to the town halls,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay, i see </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> get </OVERLAP1>
          maps, uh you know research          <OVERLAP1> history of the town </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">         <OVERLAP1> more s- more </OVERLAP1>
          specific          <OVERLAP1> activities </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          right.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you get more_ you go from being general to more specific.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay,          <OVERLAP1> (xx) good </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and, </OVERLAP1>
          that's the the scope of the whole, the whole thing is um, is you go through,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh </U2>
          the, actually from the project approach, goals is, sort of general, like          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay more conceptual </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> th- this is pretty general, </OVERLAP1>
          yes. and then, as you go down each level,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          expand, get          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> more </OVERLAP1>
          specific. until you get down to your tasks,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh </U2>
          which is, exactly what you're          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> gonna </OVERLAP1>
          do where you're          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> gonna_ who you're gonna talk to, </OVERLAP1>
          what information you're gonna gather, that sort of thing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and what we were gonna_ we're gonna focus on, objectives, predominantly objectives, and then methods, and we'll worry about tasks,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          a          <OVERLAP1> little bit later </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          on.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay, okay, i see. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then time line and budget, after we've done the tasks... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay thanks. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. sorry i forgot to </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> no uh'uh. yeah um, i i am uh i can_ i could imagine uh from Glenda's comment. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          um          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          did we talk about yesterday, um... let me backtrack here. i can see a problem, coming up between, um, Pat's style of writing, and he he wanted the um,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> show the </OVERLAP1>
          to- the, the findings of the first, in the beginning of the paragraph, where Glenda maybe used a more, um a norm- a normal, type of writing whereas sort of he put_ i don't know. but i don't know if she would agree with that or not did          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we </OVERLAP1>
          talk about that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> we didn't get into that and          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i think, </OVERLAP1>
          that_ i think they're gonna haf- that's something that they're gonna hafta decide amongst our- themselves,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          and then as far as what what they want it to look like,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um... i i i understand where Pat's coming from, but then at the same time you think about what this is being used for it's not gonna be used by, a- in a journal or          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> to a </OVERLAP1>
          state agency it's it's going to a bunch of just citizens.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, so, i think we're gonna have to talk about that,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay. yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a little bit (xx) the writing </OVERLAP1>
          style, um Pat wanted_ Pat was suggesting a a much more scientific,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          writing format,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay </U2>
          and uh, we just don't know, whether that fits in with k- with what Glenda how she envisions it, the writing style, so (we do) have to talk about that.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U2>

          okay. um, but he didn't really give us an answer to how to, to do it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then </U2>
          i tend to think that because we're doing a feasibility study and we're not saying that we're gonna come up with any divini- definitive answer, that we don't necessarily have to test anything,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm right. </U2>
          in hy- doing it in a scientific hypothesis testing approach, and we should just frame it as research          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> questions </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":15" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, um, methods          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so i think... i think these are tasks.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> yeah. </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes. </U2>
          so this i- this is a method though...          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          i think we can_ we're not doing options right? we're_ what did we come up with?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> for what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> restoration options scenarios type </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh um...          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> um </U2>
          yeah i i think i just wrote in options as a          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> option. </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          we came up with um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> now, um, Glenda indicate indicates you don't discuss possible alternatives,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> we talked about that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> uhuh </U2>
          that was what we were talking about last night.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay, so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what what we decided Hiro, um... Pa- Pat seemed to think it was really important to look at it as a system,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          and to almost look at the most, um the most extreme thing which would be the the entire, you know restoration along the entire, river, and to comment on what those changes will be, rather than narrow it down to one, one meander,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> on </OVERLAP1>
          say that park that we visited, because what might happen is that for example we look at just that park,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          then there's a lotta issues that we might not be considering.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          cuz it's on public land,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          it's not you_ there's not a lot of farm land          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> nearby </OVERLAP1>
          so it may be really easy to do it there,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          it may be very hard to do it anywhere else.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay </U2>
          so he seemed to think it was more important to look at it from a broader perspective.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          and, we also then talked about that, because it's a feasibility study we don't really need to have to suggesh suggest alternatives,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> yeah, </U2>
          and that          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          is one way to_ by looking at the broad          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> picture, </OVERLAP1>
          it's one way to sort of cover all the alternatives,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm, </U2>
          in the sense that anything less than that would be a plausible alternative that may have less impact. and what we'll do is in the end of our study in our conclusions,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          we'll sort of make recommendations, that, there may be other approaches that you could take, that would be less, have less of an impact.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay. </U2>
          and that would sorta be our discussion          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, mhm, okay. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> of alternatives. </OVERLAP1>
          just in a very sorta general, um, sense.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay... </U2>
          and and Glenda so- sh- m-          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          that covered it don't you think that's          <OVERLAP1> sort of what </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, </OVERLAP1>
          i think so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> does that make sense? okay... um... so i think with these, we need to, save all of this, and we can use that in a in the task          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> (yep) </U2>
          section. but, for the methods i think we need to also sort of do this in paragraph form.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well yeah          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i- uh </OVERLAP1>
          but i don't know, i mean what can_ more can you say about collect baseline information,          <OVERLAP1> than </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> say what </OVERLAP1>
          it is say what the baseline information is.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> like baseline information on river flow, and, um, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it it's sort of it's sorta the same stuff but without um          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          i guess it would be like okay review, um, review, information sources such as aerial photog- ai- aerial photographs, um          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay, information, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> historical records, um </OVERLAP1>
          you know and just and just, you know suggest, what material is out there that you'll be looking at, where the task would be, okay look at a aerial phota- photograph and identify, try and identify          <OVERLAP1> a historic channel, or something like that. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. okay. yeah, maybe </OVERLAP1>
          what baseline information would be um, review of historical documents, um, collect flow information, um,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> review maps, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> review maps, um, talk to people look at photographs,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep. </U2>
          just very general.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. again sort of, what we um, how we attend how we intend to uh, to, to meet our objectives...          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay </U2>
          would be,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so, one of the ways that we're gonna meet our objective for the physical, would be to get some background information, or baseline information.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but then say what that baseline information is, but not necessarily, how exactly, you know, we are we're gonna get that information.          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          and the task would be more...          <EVENT DESC="KNOCKING ON DESK"></EVENT>          so that's one thing that that's one thing that we'll each work on,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          is the area_ the stuff that we wrote up in methods.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so you did </OVERLAP1>
          the physical,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          is to sort of sort this out,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm... </U2>
          sort these things out,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> is this </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> into sort of </OVERLAP1>
          um, you know how we're gonna answer our objectives and our research questions.          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> um </U2>
          versus what,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> a question. how </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh ho- how we will, how will we_ how will we, um answer our research questions?          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> if we have an extra </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          objectives.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> we have an extra, objective in here too.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx?) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because we </OVERLAP1>
          we did, we created a new one, the,          <OVERLAP1> was it </OVERLAP1>
          the gather          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> baseline </OVERLAP1>
          information?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> okay </U2>
          so, so this is, so we should move this up... an- and i sort of envision that as being baseline information on all of the          <OVERLAP1> different areas. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay yeah, </OVERLAP1>
          you wanna explain?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, we, created a new objective          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
         <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          um... objective one, um, explore current and historical river system,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm </U2>
          so        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP">         <EVENT DESC="WRITING"></EVENT>          current?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>

          um, i, see that, having, information, on, um... the physical, a little bit of all four of the areas, information, on all four of the areas so like the physical, and this would be, that would be gathering your information, um, and then, and then the second one was, this one, um... determine how, rehabilitation will change, the physical system so, the one was, get background information on it, and then two would be then, predict, the changes that would ha- occur, in the future.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          um... so,          <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>          (xx...) one, and this is... two, (xx)        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":10" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the_ i i was just going through what we talked about yesterday.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i guess i do want a little bit more of a paragraph form for the methods.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          um, i- they said sort of, that we need to un- under methods we need to fill in the blank, a little bit fill in, you know connect all these things together,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          and explain how it_ how we're gonna get from here to there. sort of a sort of a view,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> of the methods. </OVERLAP1>
          you know it's how we're gonna get from, um, you know whatever our objective is, how we are gonna how we're gonna get from, our question that we're, we wanna answer, to the to the answer or how we're gonna get from, the objective we wanna reach.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          (and it's like)        </U1>

       <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay and ano- Hiro, and the other way that it was phrased was, a conceptual discussion of the approach, that you'll take. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="JAP"> mhm okay...          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... </U2>
          conceptual discussion...          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
          of approach.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U2>
         <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"></EVENT>          okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, that helps... um... okay actually i'm gonna hafta go,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          pretty soon. um, okay, so, if we'll just work on the, objectives and methods. is that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. lemme just write down... objectives (that we need) let me just (xx) (fix up)          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          um          <PAUSE DUR=":30" ></PAUSE>          um, mkay so these might even be shorter. i don't know.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (well) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
