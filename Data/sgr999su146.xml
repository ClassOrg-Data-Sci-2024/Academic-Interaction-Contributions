       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, i mean, </OVERLAP1>
          do you think it's okay if i wa- t- were to do a paper that didn't have an advisor? like she didn't end up reading it or          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i don't_ i mean he asks me he asked me again last week if he was my advisor for my I-C-P.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh dear </U2>
          but i know when he had me do the senior thes- you know i mean he's technically should be my advisor for that too,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but, i think he was under the impression that my professor on North Campus was gonna read it too and i might have her read it_ well actually, my big news is, involves that she probably will read it but i don't think he would care.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah mkay cuz like </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> could y- could you email it to her or something? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i was thinking about that. i'm_ the thing i'm most worried about is that i want a letter of recommendation from her and i feel like she's gonna be like, you know she didn't really turn in a very good paper for me last semester and now she's not even doing this one i only kn- i know she's only taking a couple classes like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why doesn't she have </OVERLAP1>
          like        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't think so i think that like she might feel that you're going like out of your way to do this special project          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or something. </OVERLAP1>
          and she might be like,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          this          <OVERLAP1> girl is motivated. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i need to have, </OVERLAP1>
          i need to have Frank email her and just like i think she's too_ like she thinks it's more of a thing than it is like that. you know cuz i was like oh it's like twenty-five or thirty pages and she's like well how much like ah you know she wants like,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i don't know. </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          she's not used to the R-C.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i, i thought that yeah like i thought that Mabelle my advisor was gonna she was gonna read my paper and write my          <OVERLAP1> evaluation. that's what i think. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah, that's the other thing. </OVERLAP1>
          is i'm afraid that,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that's what </OVERLAP1>
          Fra- that's actually what Frank told me.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          see that's my other problem so, if          <OVERLAP1> she needs_ </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> maybe you won't </OVERLAP2>
            be able to          </U2>
          yeah i might not be able to or i need to see if like someone else could like kinda just take it on right now or, if Frank if i could be like oh Frank will you just write it? or something like that you know.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh mhm,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          yeah. well so i got the extension from him and then i finally just ended up talking to my professor on North Campus about it. and i told her what i was interested in doing, and then i was like could i use the research? and she was like_ cuz there's several different parcels of research like, there's like five different communities i think in Detroit that they did interviews with and like s- like (peer g-) the diff- there're different characteristics for all of 'em. some of 'em are like industrial areas some of 'em are retail areas, and so some of them a- um all of them are gonna be going into the research that she does at the end of the year and stuff but also like she went to like different neighborhood organizations like, maybe like um, employment organizations and things in the area and was like do you guys want some of the information that we get from this stuff? like cuz it would probably be          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> helpful to </OVERLAP1>
          them. so that's what i've been working on a lot for her last year was doing that for a couple um like uh, industrial organizations around the area and some of them haven't been done at all. so she wanted me to do some of those um for, my project. so then          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so then i would do them and i would put that in my project. like i would have a part that was like this is empowerment zones in Detroit.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          this is um, like what local labor market theory is and then like this is one specific thing so i would on- also get i would paid for it.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> which is kind of cool. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that's nice. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i think that that, </OVERLAP1>
          that would be good because like, we're supposed to have like a other aspect besides          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          the research in our project.          <OVERLAP1> (we'll like) do something else </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          that's what he's been saying a lot is          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that like </OVERLAP1>
          it's gotta be like h- kinda hands-on or something          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like that. </OVERLAP1>
          so,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i mean, she's really hard to work with like she was just like y- i m- she's just very vague and like you can't pin her down but i got like a rough draft of s- um something someone else did for her so,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i don't know. and then i got um some good articles so i'm still reading some articles about theory but my plan is to read these articles about theory, and then um, read the rough draft that someone made          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and then </OVERLAP1>
          um, kind of propose an idea to her, and then she can like_ i don't t- i totally don't mind if she completely knocks it down because if she knocks it down          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> she'll give you </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> at least she's telling </OVERLAP1>
          me what she wants.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah exactly </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah she'll (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          cuz at this point she's not saying anything.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> like if </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think so, and i don't know whether it's more because she's more established here or whether cuz she has an economics degree from U-of          <OVERLAP1> M. </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
          when they did the the questions for this they had like a, you know thing they had with all the questions already written down so it wasn't like an informal chat or          <OVERLAP1> something? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> mhm </OVERLAP1>
          i mean i could give them the questions and have them think about it um, like i don't want to do it in survey formats cuz i haven't got surveys          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

          i'm hoping that, i on- like i'll, you know interview her again maybe and then, um the owner of um, Sweetwaters cuz it's like her c- like, Ben's cousin,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so i think she'll i'll just be like Carol said i could talk to you. and then i mean she's supposed to be on the side of like the new young female,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and um, i'm a little bit nervous about going and asking to talk to someone who like works who owns Dinersty. or a place like that cuz like i don't even know if they speak English and like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          like i'm not sure about that um, also so i i mean i need to get like certain information from the owners and i need certain information from the employees.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and so, like i mean i'm not gonna be like so you treat your workers terribly. so i don't know.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, well didn't Carol say some stuff about being able to hook you up with someone from Dinersty? or what did          <OVERLAP1> she say about that? </OVERLAP1>

          um, my friend Chris, Croftey he said the same thing to me about um his classes is like he doesn't ever think to like disagree with the author, he thinks about comparing the authors but never          <OVERLAP1> criticizing </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i mean i think that's </OVERLAP1>
          what makes a smart person, is being able to like_ i mean cuz obviously even if you don't disagree with it there are like flaws or like elements of like, you know this isn't entirely like, i don't know there're ways to criticize u- someone's approach or someone's ideas even if you think the base ideas are right and, i can't do that.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean i feel like um, but like the opposite if you do have too strong of an opinion one way then you'll always be able to critique other ones you know like it's kinda like you have to, k- like find a balance.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i mean i feel like um everything that we've read for this class like i think there's been, like i'm not really sat- like this is probably the thing that i've liked the most so far and like the other things like i've been dissatisfied with some parts satisfied with other parts but like i feel like Zach would automatically disregard all of them just because it wasn't exactly what he thinks and i think that's kind of b- that's a bad thing i think          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah like i told him i wanted him to read some of our stuff from the class cuz i was like i think it'll like, maybe like change your mind a little bit about Marxism but,          <OVERLAP1> he didn't seem to respond (xx) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well see i don't think the things we've read have </OVERLAP1>
