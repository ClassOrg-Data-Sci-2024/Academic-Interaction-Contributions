          so um, when you're talking in class this week you'll be talking about nested problem statements          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm yeah (xx)            <OVERLAP2> i know what those are </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so one solution </OVERLAP1>
          is the um, extremal hypothesis model          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it does, X Y and Z, however, you know it solved the problem by using this m- the uh extremal hypothesis model. however it doesn't work on the uh, it, it's not very good about time. so,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> now </OVERLAP1>
          the problem becomes time, and now we have a solution to the time problem, and so that's why this isn't as uh um, as attractive          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          as it once was          <OVERLAP1> because now, </OVERLAP1>

          they becoming more sophisticated every year but          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> what does that </OVERLAP1>
          do for me? by_ in what way, are they becoming more_ exactly what problem do they solve by becoming          <OVERLAP1> more </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well i mean </OVERLAP1>

          to actually move fa- i mean you know the model is moving faster instead of having_ it's the same problem that_ this is like a whole nother topic it's like, you know the old computers would take, four days to solve a problem new ones it's just like a calculator i mean everything's, quicker faster, i mean it's uh, a lot of it's speed a lot of it is uh, the other part of it would be, um... storage, you know modern computers have a lot larger hard disk than they used to and this is          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

          so... i mean i_ it was just kind of uh, i i was thinking that most of the people_ i guess what i was thinking is that most people realize w- that_ how computers are advancing, and modelling i mean, pretty much all the professors and stuff realize that modelling is getting more sophisticated and better because of the increasing speeds and capacities of computers.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> (and then) </OVERLAP1>
          i'm going into the details.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> but still_ yeah that's the details of what? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> of how they're more sophisticated. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah but what's the end          <OVERLAP1> product? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (i) mean </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          the end product is a model that...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> predicts, river bank erosion. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean, pretty much the the end product is a a model that will allow you to predict, river bank erosion, essentially. by including all these different processes.          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="READING"></EVENT>          (now) let's see          <OVERLAP1> let me read </OVERLAP1>

         <EVENT DUR=":08" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          how 'bout          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          something like this unlike extremal models geofluvial models utilize the advancement in cur- computer technology          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> this is </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the increased </OVERLAP1>
          computer speed allows the inclusion of more processors finer grade spacing and increased time steps all of which increase the accuracy of this type of model,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          all of which increase the accuracy of this type          <OVERLAP1> of model </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> accuracy, </OVERLAP2>
            okay          </U2>
          thus making geofluvial the more attractive option for the future.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> is is that the main, thing is that it's more accurate? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> not just accurate it's also more uh, it's also, faster. i mean, the solution is          <OVERLAP1> faster </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the solution </OVERLAP1>
          comes faster but the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          ultimate goal is that you have an accurate model?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right i mean that's the ultimate goal </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so so this is </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean a- a- accuracy is the ultimate goal i mean it_ they're willing to sacrifice time, for accuracy, but there reaches a point where, time does become an issue because you know no one wants to wait a month before seeing, the results.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so, that's why they're becoming, more in use because now you can turn it on run it for eight hours and get a nice prediction of what happened over the course of a month.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          whereas you know maybe five ten years ago, you know what takes place in our time as a second might take place in ten seconds in computer time          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whereas </OVERLAP1>
          now it's opposite you know we can do ten seconds real time in one second computer time.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          type of thing. so, well anyway, does that sound better if i just          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          there is extremal p- there's_ these are the two types of models, the geofluvial model's better, um one of the geofluvial models is, Kovacs-Parker, task force likes Kovacs-Parker, that's why_ that's, one of the big reasons i am, doing this. and that's          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, you know that the Kovacs-Parker, is, a, good solution. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but don't you </OVERLAP1>
          need to set up_ okay so alright          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, yeah </U2>
          i- if i put it in a small paragraph here,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
          then i won't have addressed any of the deficiencies, and i need to talk about where it's good before i talk about its deficiencies. i i          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> could put </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          basically what i did is i do a quick description of the Parker-Kovacs model here          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> based </OVERLAP1>
          on these two paragraphs, and then say okay, this is          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what's, </OVERLAP1>
          where it's lacking this is what i'm gonna do          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          i see your p- i see your point exactly obviously but um i could put a small paragraph in here saying, um, the goal of this research is to, um, make some of the, well i was wondering about s-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think this is perfect the way it said it right here, is to address          <OVERLAP1> some of the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but then put put it up to here, </OVERLAP2>
            or leave it there?          </U2>
          mm, some of the more significant deficience_ u- mm, is to improve on the Kovacs-Parker model and, um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but i- should i_ you're s- you're, commenting on it being buried in the third paragraph          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean i could move that, sentence, up here but i can't leave the rest          <OVERLAP1> of this paragraph </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> actually this is a </OVERLAP1>
          good sentence too.        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":09" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so how 'bout, we do something like </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know what?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> this is </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i don't </OVERLAP1>
          i don't think you should decide yet. i think this week is a- is perfect timing, the lectures this week are perfect timing for you and i think you should, listen on, Tuesday and Thursday          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          because i think uh i i think it'll just, really fall into place for you but, uh some of the things that i've out- um highlighted today, um... you're ready          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you're ready. uh i wanted to talk to you about um... did you, work on your node diagram?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, a little bit, not too much </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> that would be really helpful, uh whe- when is it due? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what? the          <OVERLAP1> proposal? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
          diagram.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm there is no diagram due. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh that's not? really...? hm... um okay, so          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          so there wasn't an actual assignment you just          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U2>
          discussed          <OVERLAP1> it </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yup </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          well then, i'm gonna give you some homework          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i think it would be really, helpful and um, if you have trouble with it i think, it would be great for you to make an appointment with Professor Olsen        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh i don't think i'll have a problem with it it just_ i don't know there's other things i'm just working on right now. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but </U2>
          i think it would go_ it would, blend nicely, and really help you along this way so with the node diagram and with the two lectures this week, i think it'll really help you shake out, a nice introduction, um, okay so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the, the one thing i was thinking of if i go into the node diagram,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i basically figured that i would have to throw out,          <OVERLAP1> numerous </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no i don't </OVERLAP1>
          mean it goes in your paper.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh cuz i_ cuz if i use the node diagram as an introduction then i really          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no no no no no no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> have to give up all that cuz it won't </OVERLAP1>
          flow at all.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no all_ it's it's uh as, just, almost like an an alternative to an outline. where you, um, you see, the flow, from the problem statement, to, s- n- suggested </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the, the problem_          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uh, solutions </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the node </OVERLAP1>
          diagram she talked about was a historical one. in terms of going back          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well you can do it that            <OVERLAP2> way too but, it's an idea </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean that's that's the only one she talked about, it's different than uh, </OVERLAP1>
          cuz i_ what i assume you're talking about is something more like, here's the problem          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then here are solutions to the problem.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          that's yeah it's a little diff- it's_ she kinda addressed that but she actually had it going back (forever) um          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well sh- i            <OVERLAP2> think </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but there's </OVERLAP1>
          more than one_ i mean, now, in terms of addressing that way the problem, isn't it really like five problems though for this, cuz i'm talking about the five deficiencies          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well            <OVERLAP2> then, then um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and then, i mean so </OVERLAP1>
          i mean, basically it's like, it's, it's almost like          <OVERLAP1> here's the model </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but they all, </OVERLAP1>
          but they all,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> stem from just, from that </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> come stem from what's </OVERLAP1>
          the what's the, okay,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> from the Kovacs-Parker model </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and the and the </OVERLAP1>
          Kovacs-Parker. but the Kovacs-Parker is, one solution_ it's just one of many solutions to, what's the big,          <OVERLAP1> picture? what's the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> river bank river bank erosion </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean yeah you could have river bank erosion, and then there are f- the fi- i mean i could you know          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          they all would_ there's like, twelve models alone, reviewed in that paper.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm mhm over_ another_ i just wanna talk in general, um, overall, i i feel like you're, um, u- um, using different terms, for the same, thing and i feel like they're not fully defined          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well there's_ yeah that's one of the problems though, unlike a lot of other, unlike a lot of other, disciplines          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          where, steel is steel is steel,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          unfortunately in a lot of civil engineering especially what i'm getting into the_ there's so many, different terms i mean people in, the Midwest say things different than the Southeast say things_ you know there's a lot of terms for the same thing          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and now </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that's one            <OVERLAP2> reason </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and there </OVERLAP1>
          and there's slight, there is slight,          <SIC> frequent </SIC>
          there are slight defi- i mean there are slight differences between them          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, but i guess i was trying to encompass, mm, i don't know exactly what i wanna say but i guess i was, trying to encompass, you know address, some different terms for similar things,          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that's </OVERLAP1>
          good,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> channel            <OVERLAP2> morphology </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's good </OVERLAP1>
          but you kinda need to do it right          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          up front          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well it's </OVERLAP1>
          kinda like channel morphology is anything that changes in the channel, anything.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so river, bank erosion is a subset of channel morphology.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay great          <OVERLAP1> great great </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay? </OVERLAP1>
          so i mean, i don't know what, ah but see that's not, no this can't be from the same tree anymore y- you're talking          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> about </OVERLAP1>
          okay i mean well, it could be like way way up here          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it can't </OVERLAP1>
          be up there          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so now i don't know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> what what are some other types of channel morphology? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (i don't know)          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you know there          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i            <OVERLAP2> yeah, i can't </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know the bottom_ </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          well i mean if you stand in a river what do you see i mean there's banks, and braided channels i mean there's yeah there's tons of 'em. i mean if you look at a river, and even a change (xx) river is a chain- is a type but i mean that's way, like you said that's way up        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> up the chain </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and and you're </OVERLAP1>
          not concerned with these things? you are          <OVERLAP1> concerned with, river bank erosion </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh i'm mo- yeah, with river bank erosion </OVERLAP1>
          um, i'm slightly concerned with channel morphology as well and i talk about that because we do have the uh, we do have_ i wanna in- one of the things i wanna include in the Ko- Kovacs-Parker model is changes in the longitudinal direction.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> which is </OVERLAP1>
          actually the riverbed changes.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so another one that you (interested in) is longitudinal direction change. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, and you're gonna be talking about_ and that's different than river bank erosion? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right,          <OVERLAP1> but i- but it's gonna be yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay, so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i i would, i really would like to see you,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure </U2>
          take it back, you know and maybe, channel morphology is just one of, you know          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a bunch of </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> now if </OVERLAP1>
          mkay, i i can_ i have to get going like real badly          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, oh sorry sorry </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, but uh, yeah but i could take it back that far i guess i um you know maybe after i do that i'll see how i might work it in can i have the, the front page, too? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> here? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yup </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh </U2>
          cuz i'd like to hear what you have to say about the uh lectures, this week        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i i might go, i mean if i can take it back there it's, uh, i don't we_ yeah i'll think about how i wanna try and do that. i have i've already thought          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i hope you'll be inspired </U2>
          well i- i i've already thought that i've, probably put too much in on that uh, task force          <OVERLAP1> there </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i don't_ </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          extremal models technically is not, relevant wh- or the the extremal hypothesis models that i mention in there,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          (frankly) that's not relevant whatsoever          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          it's just, there's two ways of solving it, and so i mention the two ways and then i          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          kinda discard it it's really not relevant whatsoever, so that's the kinda thing where i think          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> well i think we'll really take off </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
