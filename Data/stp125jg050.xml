       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> (um. or Mark?) okay. we have two sites, one is on North Campus which uh, if uh this is the, Pierpont Commons the Media Union and the bell tower, this is Bonisteel here, and Murfin goes up the hill here, uh so the site is really, largely where the current parking lot is, to the north of Pierpont Commons. or that slope. that whole area was open for, choice. and the other site is um, in town on Central Campus, uh State Street is here, um Student Union, West Quad,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> (looks exactly like) </U2>
          Thompson Street Thompson Street parking structure. this is currently used as grade level parking. alright um, and Blimpy Burger is here, (lying down,) okay? just to set the context. this is South Quad. so the two sites uh you'll see schemes on both sites through the afternoon. okay, some students have been working individually and some have been working in pairs. so um, this is obviously a pair.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="ITA"> um, in looking at the uh, North Campus, we found that, it's quite obvious um, that there's a suburban feel to, the environment and, what we've tried to do with our scheme, uh was kind of two things. one was try to reduce the, um suburban feel like the Media Union has, um, on this side of the street to the, the front of the building and, as well as somehow try to, address, the um, quadrangle, uh which is, uh presently which presently is starting to look like it's forming. um, and we realized that our building doesn't complete the quad and, uh we're trying to attempt to, somehow, um get a sense of a new, way of designing, uh buildings for, uh, North Campus. so what we've done basically is try to, um bring over the Murfin, Road and, have our building, interact with the street as well as with the quad. um in a larger uh... master plan, if you will. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="ITA"> yeah Murfin, currently goes straight down, so what we've done is we          <SIC> curve </SIC>
          it bring it over so that we could have, the road um, interact with the building as well as have, our building, um interact with the quadrangle.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, let me go through this uh, programmatically if uh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> George, i can't </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> let me go through uh, programmatically. the uh, the main entrance uh, to our building, is where the roof, where there's an existing roof where this, this is the uh ground floor plan, where this is the Pier Commons, and there's the um, existing roof that exists there right now, we're planning on keeping that and using that as the main entrance into the building. whereby, you can sorta see it in this view right here, and um, so the main entrance, um is like, this point right here. it sorta edges you into, a what you call, vestibule, because it's sorta separated from the rest of the building as a, sort of very public, uh primary ci- uh, circulation space. now this is one of, one of three that we have, um, this is one finger primary uh circulation could be allowed, publicly as long as this finger right here, um, when i describe this finger uh um, my uh concept was that, these fingers which is the circulation space, (were) sort of um uh cocooned in the studio space, cuz we thought that studio space was, was very much, um, very much uh, the the sacred space of an architecture building so we wanted to, to really um, to uh enclose it and, sort of make this space uh, you know not necessarily, um closed to the public, but maybe certain parts open to the public but, um something that you, you can go to but, can't really see from the exterior of the building. so, s- you enter through the building, and um, and um, these are the two fingers as i mentioned before. now in the ground floor, we have all of our public spaces as soon as you enter you get an exhibition space right here. um where we'd have a coffee shop, we have a lecture hall auditorium, a public I-T-D space which, not necessarily is for the, computing space for the whole, School of Architecture but, more for public use. we have a, computer (xx) upstairs i mentioned. and, around this other um, circulation space, on the ground floor we have a mechanical space right here. i'll talk a little bit more about that afterwards but on the right-hand side of it we get our, computer classes areas um, you know you get your seminars right here, you got your workshop right here. and on the other finger of the circulation space, we get our G-S-I labs, we get our high-bay spaces this is them right here. now on the ground floor, what we did what we decided to do for the parking was that, we decided um, we're gonna use the existing parking but we're gonna cover it so there is, we're saying that th- there isn't gonna be any sort of an, excavation we're building from the existing grade up. so, we're we decided that we're gonna have parking, within our building, coming off of a street, off of Murfin, entering into as a one-way, coming back out, and out back out that way out to Murfin. as our, as programmatically for the parking spaces that are required. um, ways of getting on- onto the second floor now there's a couple of ways of doing that. uh from the main entrance, there is an accessibility, of, uh a set of stairs and elevator here, or, you can go up um, a one-hundred-and-eighty-foot ramp, one-to-twelve ratio scale for the handicap accessibility up until the studio space. uh, you don't quite get right into studio space as soon as you get up. um, you get into this other catwalk that runs back the other way, which, actually connects you to, this other piece which is another sort of face of our building, which is across the street, which um, is the admin, uh offices on the ground-floor plan, and_ but when you come up, the ramp onto the second floor, you bridge across, you get directly in- into faculty offices, which went two stories up from that, and one more top for G-S-Is, PhDs... so. um, getting back to over here, um we get back into the catwalk right here. this coffee space runs two stories. so, you can actually access um, studio-level floor, from the studio-level floor down into the coffee shop into this two-story area space. so, basically, you get up to this point right here. right here, um, where we have our coffee, um copy center sorry, area, um sorta publicly um, publicly located, and then after we get an extension of our studio space which is on one floor. so an existing building on this side is only a two-story building. where studio spaces are subdivided... and we get our cre- we get our c- uh computer (pool areas.) uh which is uh, interconnected within, within those studio spaces. now that's one part of the studio, but... um the crit spaces are located right here, facing uh, and so now, this view right here. alright that view is actually sort of standing right here, and looking up that way. so i'm getting a view into studio, but i_ you get a you get a view also of the crit spaces that's located right here, on this other, um circulation space. whereby on the same level as the studio space, i bridge across, over these um, over these three bridges that exist one two and three, over into, our classroom area, um, which is another, which is sorta separated from studio yet somewhat, connected by these bridges... and um, we have our typical, all the, the fire exit uh requirements um, two hundred feet (there'll be a) fire exit (stair.) um... yeah, um let me just explain some of the views if you can't read it this is the main entrance view up so as soon as you enter, you get this round going up... you get your exhibition space will be right here, and you get your auditorium, lecture hall, and your I-T-D in on the corner. so you can kinda...          <U2 WHO="SU" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> could you talk (xx) </U2>
          this is the studios, uh, this is the back, this is the back finger (hole) which is, this finger right here. there by, you know, go by, you tr- you're trying to introduce um, the public into the building, because, in a way this_ the_ there's there's a couple layers are full of (pull living) you can see, that you get, you get this, you get this, later, and after you get, you know, sort of this layer within a layer. so you get your studio space encapsulated with as i said with the, circulation finger space. whereby_ where the public can sort of feed in and so they'll start to interact, with the architecture building a little bit better, which uh i don't think that this building provides, as much interaction, they seem sort of very closed off (lately...) these views right here, as i said before these are uh, these are the um, the main entrance nook, which exists, and that's our main entrance, with uh, with the (xx) center facing out. this is uh, looking south um... northwest, coming up...          <OVERLAP1> but you can </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but this is on Murfin? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is fr- </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, this is looking Murfin looking south and that's the Media Union, and that's the Pier Commons in the background, and this is looking from the engineering side, so this is the Media Union on that side right there this is the bell tower, and that's the architecture building right there... um we wanted um, i guess you can see if, i wouldn't wanna leave admin. the admin was, meant to be this space whereby it's, i know it you know, we wanted to make this, sort of a_ we wanted to use this space because we wanted to (really) interconnect the road, with the courtyard. so, by us, putting this, putting this um, this other face of our building on this side of the road, we sorta try to use this, try to try to, use um use this green space to our advantage. uh whereby it's it's very uh sparsely used right now at the moment, so i think by by doing that i guess, you start to, start to get a sense of that_ of the interaction that that could possibly happen, with that space, and for future development we'd be rooting for this area between us, our possible architecture building and the Music School. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="ITA"> professors now can't complain that they're, away from students and, they'll have their own private spaces so they're, uh in the woods so to speak. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz we don't need necessarily a right answer to it but we, i guess you know since we started to try to do that because the coffee area sort of leads right into this area right here, you can see </U1>

          this is Bonisteel and that's that corner, so... what this is is parking and mechanical. and that_ so that's an extension of the building and coming down Murfin i think that threshold would be the new entrance to North Campus. so it wouldn't be a bleeding edge it would basically be, a sort of um, an announcement. and, that's in this location, so that's Murfin this is north this is the building and this is heavily wooded, there's dormitories over here so there's a lot of foot traffic that way, and right now there's a path that kind of crosses right at right across this roof, to the engineering building, and the engineering building's a real destination that's here, because there's a huge atrium in there and a lot of students go over there and hang out and eat food and stuff, so i basically rerouted that. the concept here is to to to take, all of the traffic from that side of campus and route it through the building this way and anyone coming that way, would come through, here. so there's kind of a, public zone, in this middle level on that gray sheet of, chipboard that's kind of the most public, accessible part of the building, and if someone were to come to the building from, the grade level which is right now the parking level, so that would be, this lower, public, enlarged courtyard, they would come in underneath and slip under that public space and, and i added some program for the North Campus site i added a bookstore and, and what could probably double-function as library, and there was a cafe in the program so that's all on that lowest level. and from there you, you come up through, that's here, and through there this cavity here is a double height, open to the sky, void. that comes straight through, the that middle layer. and that gives light to the offices on that level. so you'd come up the stairs here, and that would bring you right into this central what i call the gathering space, and that would intersect your path with whoever was coming through the building the other way, and, that's basically the heart of the building. in section, that's here. and it's kind of a, it's kind of a jogged space, and here, so it it sort of does that, but it's continuous. so once you're in that space you, the r- the studio is above your head, and it's ramping, and the offices are off to either the left or right which would be, um, this is the office plate. there's some offices in there which are kind of temporary, three-quarter partition sorts things          <OVERLAP1> not_ yes? louder </OVERLAP1>

          big space inside but the skin on the outside and one of the things, that i wanted to do is basically, stay away from that. and so that you you can see the space literally without its skin, and then the other thing was, um all these buildings are pretty deeply and complexly linked into the ground, actually exactly the same as this. they just don't show it. so, i think um...          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U2>

         <OVERLAP1> that's the real, plan. </OVERLAP1>
          yeah. it's_ up to the corner of Hayward and Murfin is about eighty feet i think so, this is, it still rises some.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> (well,) d- you've said a number of things which have triggered things in my mind but i i can't quite put it together into a comment          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so let me </OVERLAP1>
          just, let me be episodic. i me- w- one of the things that is happening in, higher-tech buildings be they office buildings or maybe architecture schools, is that there's a is a movement toward services in floors. you know um, um, support floors that have not only cable and conduit but they also have duct work, and that the registers are no longer, these things, but they're literally things that come up as part of the furniture. so you could have just the amount of ventilation and cooling and heating that you want. it may even come out of your computer. i mean, it's happened.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and so so you're quite right in saying that the floor is becoming more, latent. and thick. at the same time the r- the roof still has to span.          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's not paper thin </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's not paper thin          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          or or if it i- if you want it to be paper thin it could be but then, it has implications for how often it's supported and, and a whole bunch of things. so if you if you wanna say okay the floor is gonna be this fat thing, which sort of sits on the grade, there is this natural grade, and more or less what i'm doing is i'm putting really smart floors on it. and then i'm gonna put these really thin roofs, because they can be really thin, that can be_ strikes me as a wonderful conceit on which to start a project on. maybe you're doing that. i'm not a whole, a hundred percent sure. but, but then you'd have to make sure, from the structural point of view that the the roof forms are such that they can be that thin thing so you can read them, you know in the way you're wanting us to read them. so that those, (windows.) and i believe you can do that but, but i think that maybe the column spacing          <OVERLAP1> and some of the other things you're gonna </OVERLAP1>

          it's not but one of the things that um, now that it's come up, is this main system of supports is, this broad kind of flat pier sort of things and that, i think will make the interior seem like it's got this long, space to it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so you're saying          <U2 WHO="S11" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but the second </OVERLAP2>

          and it's light outside still... um, we chose the Central Campus site. um, mainly thinking about what a studio was. and uh we decided that, this is what an architecture school is the studio is, the heart and the soul, and we wanted to represent that. um, so considering it as a jewel we wanted to sort of, show it off in a lot of ways and we started thinking about it as something which should be sheltered, within a wrapper. and then we wanted to expose it a little bit more. and start to show it off and have it break through the wrapper in a lot of ways. so um, we ended up with the studio at the heart of the building, with a strong wrapper on the edge of the site. which uh, breaks in certain parts. with th- where this site is, Central Campus downtown, in kind of, more student sections, the way the wrapper breaks to show off the studio occurs, in different manners, depending on which side of the studio, it breaks through.        </U1>

          defensive scheme against the rest of the city in the sense that we are really trying to use our site as a gateway for the rest of campus and we did, close off this street from the main reason t- as we saw this as one of the major elements for_ both vehicular traffic and pedestrian traffic and we really wanted to use that and to exemplify the site and have this really be a gateway to the corner of campus. um        </U1>

          sorry i apologize. um, it's the idea of visual penetration into the idea of the studio. the idea that you can see into the studio and all the services wrap around the studio so that you have constant visual interaction with the studio, and the other public, places in the building and Tara will talk about, the break between the school and the public.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, being that we, we blocked off the street we used that as our major entrance into the building, so as you come through up, you enter, right at the knuckle where there's a central stair and you_ and we broke down the program into basically public and private functions. where cafe exhibition, and auditorium are on this end, the more public functions and then all the classrooms studios at the center, offices things that have more to do with the private functions of, the building, are to the other direction. um, but you always maintain this visual contact back and forth the courtyard, through, the glazed exterior. you know back into the studio it's always, you know something you have to acknowledge. as you move through the building, um we wanted to keep the studio as its own jeweled element but, still have connections through it, so, you don't walk through it really but you sort of pass, through it over a catwalk and there are visual, well there are actually um... little shafts through the building so you walk down a catwalk like penetrating the studio and you can always penetrate through it. so you, you're always mixing with it. and the way that the program is broken down, um with the classrooms and the offices they all, sort of open out into this courtyard. the circulation, goes all the way around and then through. so you're always acknowledging, the studio and the happenings of the studio, the presence of the Architecture School. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um to complement the idea of the courtyard we also have an internal void um, that is on the other side of the studio that allows for light in the inner core of the building, a-          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (this one) </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it's a dilemma. i mean i know why you did it it makes sense to me on some levels but,          <OVERLAP1> (you just) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> cuz otherwise </OVERLAP1>
          we only have our, single (out_ you need) really deep planned space, but        </U1>

          too thin in relationship to what it's wrapping around          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U2>
          so your enclosure your s- your your wrapping has kind of_ changes proportion as it continues to wrap around and it and it's so contorted you almost don't see it as a sinuous piece wrapping          <OVERLAP1> (of the box) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> can i can i fo- add on to that? another way of looking at it was was there a flaw in this? that because, at bottom level you couldn't get the light into it and maybe you have to reexamine, it on the basic level,          <U2 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> ah yeah </U2>
          this k- sort of model, before going onto just you know trying to work it out.          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so you spotted the floor when you were doing the working out and then maybe you had to go back          <U2 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> back </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> to this one, and </OVERLAP1>
          and i don't know what the answer is.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> when could you do these? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> we did them after midterm crit </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> is there          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>

       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S12" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the idea had always been there          <OVERLAP1> (but it just wasn't down) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S13" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the idea          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U2>
         <OVERLAP1> had been there, </OVERLAP1>
          and after_ we had, we had presented in some of ideas didn't get quite across so we we went and stepped back and, started with our basic analysis drawing and did the, the series.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE"> what i_ i must say i i can't see the_ having the void on the north side of the studio is a fatal flaw. i really don't see that. i can see that there are difficulties in resolving it but there are there are voids all the way around the studio.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="VO" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (it even exceeds that) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="ALL">RESTRICTED</U2>
          and the voids vary in their dimension.        </U1>
