   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, now basically this is uh, a study on um, i wanted to look at um, the bilingual population here at the University of Michigan, and i started out thinking i would just look at, whatever people i could find who were bilingual, and then i realized that it would be difficult to kind of, find anything out about it if i was just looking at whatever languages i came up with. so i ended up concentrating on two different languages, and um, i also concentrated on the easiest samples i could find, so i have a Spanish um, English bilingual sample, taken from a class actually of self identifying U-S Latinos. so that's something to consider, and then i have um, a sample from, a Hindi class, uh two Hindi classes actually here, which are mostly bilingual um heritage speakers of Hindi, or another Indian language. um, and, uh basically, no one other language is highly represented besides Hindi but i'll talk about the littl- that a little bit in a minute. um the things that i was really looking for were, uh, had to do with, theoretical affiliation, with um a language community, which might serve as a community using these uh measures, basically, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> Helen </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> can you put the window, down? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the which? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the window, down? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the window down?          <EVENT DESC="NOISE DISRUPTION"></EVENT>          see if i can get those um...          <EVENT DESC="NOISE DISRUPTION"></EVENT>         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH" WHO="SS"></EVENT>          um, that helps a little          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U2>
          okay, um okay the first thing i was looking at is theoretical affiliation like do you think that you will be basically affiliated with this language community in this way in the future (that's what) (xx) um so first i ask, i just sort of_ these are just theoretical right though they have nothing to do with what we are doing now and i'll, talk a little bit about one other thing they ask that's about right now, in a minute but these're basically, the main things i was looking at. and i also looked at the importance of maintaining or increasing their proficiency in language A, um, for the vari- these various reasons. and, what i ended up doing in terms of figuring out what these meant and how they correlated was, looking at um, basically what i did for these scores or these answers, is i gave them two, points if they, said yes one point if they say maybe and zero points if they say no so i have an aggregate score for that, and i have um an average, score for this one. um, depending on various things and i also i'll show you a little bit about how those broke down, um... there's a lot of different things you can consider in terms of what will influence, you know how someone, perceives their own identity and how important it is for them to maintain their other language. um basically with students at the U-of-M, we're looking at people who, um, are basically social- socially mobile, so um, i sort of went in assuming that i would find people who would be more tending to be agents of language shift, rather than language retention, um in the sense that they, most of the students um, like in the in the Spanish, bilingual, Spanish English bilingual sample, three out of eleven, had grown up in a Latino neighborhood or, i_ whatever, i i measured that just by saying, you know, do you h- did you have neighbors who were spoke Spanish did you have um classmates who spoke Spanish? and only three of them answered yes to either of those. so basically most of them did not grow up in a bilingual community, except for that of their parents, and i've done qualitative interviews i haven't, finished evaluating all of that yet but basically, for the qualitative, work it seems like most of the students, did indeed grow up in um an integrated community, and they often say well i spoke Spanish or Hindi with my parents friends or their childre- their par- my parent's friends' children, but i didn't, you know have friends at school who spoke it or whatever. um another thing to consider of course is the different language groups, um, Hindi obviously, uh, is not, as widespread in the United States as Spanish is, um so in terms of usefulness or, accessibility in the United States it's a little different. so i'm just gonna look at some differences between the two groups, for a moment here, um, this is the, answer to th- the second question which is about the importance of, um, th- these various reasons for maintaining or increasing, fluency in language A (alright,) um, and i've got this little, graph at the bottom, which basically tells you that, i- i've sort of labeled this so, um, basically for the Hindi class, seventy-five percent answered_ had an average of this or higher, the seventy-fifth percentile, half of them had this or higher, twenty-five percent, so you can see that the Hindi class has a much, um, lower range basically, of answers okay, and you can basically, see that that's from these two, numbers here, i circled them here, um, okay, um so for professional and academic reasons, Hindis, were rated not that much more- much lower than the Hindi speakers- than the Spanish speakers. um, and that was pretty much across the board, and, we can think of some obviously um reasons for that, uh... another interesting thing you can see there's some variability um i don't think that the rest of it's very significant though, um, the variability in the different ranges, um there is some variability though there is still like, this is relatively low compared to the other scores, for Spanish speakers, to the academics but it's still relatively high, this was just- a rating of four just means important, anyway so, and then, just to look at the other, thing i was interested in measuring, this is the questions on theoretical affiliation, and i broke these down into proportions so this is like basically like thirty-six percent, (xx) fifty-five percent. um, so for this- for the Spanish um, the Spanish English bilingual sample, or the Spanish class i should just say um, basically, there's a lot more, um, higher ratings in the in the yes category like, a lot more people who said yes to um, to everything, and there's also very few people who said no to anything. you'll see here most people said at least maybe, you know, or yes. um and that again might have something to do with the also the sample is taken from a U-S Latino_ self-identifying U-S Latino class, and so students who are in this class presumably are already relatively invested in being a U-S Latino in the sense that they self-identify um, but at the same time, um the Hindi speakers, um, no one said no for example, no they would not marry a Hindi speaker, but um, you know two people i believe that represents two people who said they would never marry someone who was a Spanish English bilingual. basically. okay. um, and you can see again there's, a higher distribution for the Spanish speakers than the Hindi speakers for the aggregate score, like all these together, um, (let's) see and the other interesting things, th- only one person i think said yes they would live in a country where Hindi was spoken basically India right, um, whereas, um several people said yes they would, (live, in) live in a Spanish speaking country, definitely and um, let's see, the other interesting thing is that hardly anybody said that, they would not raise their children bilingually, (okay) in any of the samples there's two people total, in both samples that said that they, would would not raise their children bilingually. or maybe actually they didn't say would not they said maybe i won't. you know          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and one of them like even wrote a comment in like i'm not sure if i'm proficient enough to bring my children up bilingually          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          like i want to but, so basically you can see by just, looking at that that, basically for all of the students sampled they are all pretty invested in, thinking that bilingualism is a good thing, you know, over all, something they want to pass on to their children, in the interviews that comes out as well... um, so i was interested also in how these correlate i was sayi- thinking you know m- well maybe some people are interested in being part of this community the bilingual community, but they're not really interested in, um, having, uh, high, their (own,) high proficiency (in the) language, so there is a high, (um,) there is a high correlation between these two things so, this is the average, this is the average score of like the five point rating thing and this is the aggregate score of like yes maybe no, do you want to do this do you want to do that, um, and there's like a high correlation i think it's point, seven two        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> sorry could you just be clearer on what's correlated with what </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="CITE" FLANG="SPA">RESTRICTED</U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay um, this is the average interest so this is like, um rate, the following um, how important is it for you to maintain or increase language A and you can just put this up, uh, rate that on a scale of one through five basically for the following reasons. (xx) right there, that's the bottom one. (aggregate interest,) and then i just averaged their scores okay, and that's the scale , this is the aggregate score so they get two points for every yes and one point for every maybe, so somebody who has twelve answered yes to everything, okay, somebody who has a three probably only answered yes to one thing maybe, to another representative of that so, and there's, you know there's definitely variability you know there's, people who, it's really important to them to, to maintain language A and yet they have a pretty low theoretical affiliation but there is a correlation of um, uh, this is th- this- these are the questions (xx) um... i was interested in the marrying someone who speaks language A thing for the Hindi speakers and i actually ended up asking, some people in the qualitative interview whether they were interested in arranged marriages, and i only had one person say they were intr- they were considering it still so, but um since that's, a big thing for recent immigrants (of course) especially... um okay... now another thing that, um, i realized when i started looking at this is i asked a question, are you involved in any religious organizations student organizations, classes, whatever in in- th- where people speak language A, and um just correlating with the religion thing, got actually a really pretty high, correlation, so this is just like yes or no d- do you participate in a religious organization (xx) (people) (xx) okay, um, and you see this is the average of the five so this is the, you know how important it is for you maintain the language, and you can see that, um, this is, these are both for the Spanish sample. so for the Spanish sample i mean these are pretty low numbers so it's kind of weird to see it in this form but this just basically means that, we are (xx) (black) (line) (notes) fifty percent, whatever answered higher than that, so you can see that everybody, who's yes involved in their religious organization they did all fives, for all of the treatments, so, um, and, here again you see that, like ha- half of, all this, like two of these students are all, gave almost all yesses basically for all those (added) questions um, this_ it's kind of weird to see this and these low numbers i tried to this like that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> have you got a misprint there? is one of them empty? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no these are all Spanish classes these are, for religion or yes or no. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> aah          <OVERLAP1> (xx) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and th- the in </OVERLAP1>
          and this is oh this is the aggregate score for like,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> i see </U2>
          do you imagine yourself imagine- marrying somebody who speaks language A. so this is just for the Spanish one, and they say a, a little different, uh, distribution with the, Hindi class, but, with similar overall results except for the, um this is reversed so let me just do it one at a time, this is the aggregate score, so you see again there's a higher, (like) median, um, this is like for yes no maybe do you wanna marry somebody (you wanna,) do you- do you think you'll marry someone who speaks language A or whatever. um, that's definitely still higher for people who are involved in religious organizations now, but it's a little more spread out, (and i) (xx) the- the Spanish sample seemed pretty_ more polarized there's also fewer people in the Spanish sample who are involved in a religion, here there's, the opposite there's nine, uh students involved in a religion and four are not, so, but then these this is kind of, bizarre I don't know what to make of this but i'll just show it to you, um this is for the, uh, this is for the average grading of (reasons) and, there's this huge spread for the people who said yes, and then there's this really small spread of people who said no, and so that's- maybe this says that maybe religion doesn't correlate with um the importance of speaking Hindi as much for these students okay um, that's- i mean it's a small sample so it's hard to make these kind of conclusions but, it does seem like, it could be different than the Spanish sample where, there was a high correlation in both cases with being involved in religion. okay... so um basically, what i came up with i guess is that there is um, that language is really important, to these students in terms of their affiliation with this community bilingual community or their cultural community maybe in a a larger sense to say that because, the other thing about this is, they are taking this class and language which means that they are investing time and energy in learning this language but it also means that they don't_ they're not already super proficient in this language right, so they're not like, um, the ideal bilingual and we all know that that doesn't happen very often but, but they you know they're not like um, going from being already you know totally maybe a part of this community and then taking this class of course cuz they're wanting to improve it, um, especially for the Spanish speakers i would say that i guess just because when you talk about Hindi speakers i just imagine it being more, i mean, if you're not even learning those char- that character set in school you know, um and a lot of the_ from the qualitative interviews um a lot of what i got was that people, um rejected their their home language as a child, they'd often say oh i you know i told my parents to stop speaking Spanish to me you know all this stuff when they were a kid, um and but now i want to. you know so there's this kind of change in heart sort of coming with, age and um, the other thing is that, it's interesting to see why it is that students want to revive their other language in a sense, okay, and basically what i n- uh, what i decided is that they are basically interested in it because of um, they want to use it as a way to, be part of this um cultural identity these are (the same) quotes as i had before so people who've seen this already, it's boring but, um basically these are two interviews um where basically students said right out the reason i want to speak Spanish is because, i um, i want, i want to be considered Latino and i feel like this is, like, validates me in some way basically what they're saying so they, he says, because i don't look like a Latino person, since i'm not brown, uh let's see, are they wha- are your kids gonna be you know Hispanic, and so i wanna know you know i wanna speak Spanish basically. is kinda what it's coming down to and this student has the same basic idea she says, um, it's part of myself i really wanted to get back, that back, that back you know and then she says, basically i look African-American, and most of my friends have been Afro-American so i really haven't had that much, in, you know so she's basically getting this, idea that she wants to um be part of a Latino community, in some way, that she hasn't been so far and she feels like Spanish is gonna come- some how, help her, um her overall identity with that. so that's kind of what's going on with the qualitative data i haven't finished analyzing the rest of my qualitative data so that's all of, that for now. um, i'm trying to think, how am i doing on time?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> okay, we didn't really talk about timing how how much more have you got? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> how much more have i got? i, that's that's most of it i could say a couple more things but </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> well </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>

          and i think we have twenty minutes for questions.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> get my </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> i think we made it twenty minutes a piece, didn't we? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i think and then time for questions, and then there's uh... (i don't) (have this) it's in my bag... um, the one other interesting thing is and i already talked about this in my other presentation but um there was this distribution lemme just find that,          <EVENT DESC="LOOKS IN BAG"></EVENT>          there was this distribution in terms of who asked people who they spoke Spanish or English with or who they spoke (xx) language A who do you speak language A with, and um... there was this thing that is typical of the bilingual population (at first) but it's interesting to see it, um, where you get the, speaking both with their parents fourteen out of this is for both language groups. fourteen out of uh, i guess twenty-four total spoke, speak both with their parents okay, six speak only language A with their parents, um, but with siblings you see a much higher rate of speaking only English okay so a lot of students told me this in interviews too they said i only speak English with my with my brother or whatever, um some speak both very few speak only language A. only one person only speaks language A with his friends uh i think that was a he, um, uh and eight only speak English, which is um, less in fact than people who only speak English with their um          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          with their siblings but the thing about the friends thing i should just say that this- this whole friends line is kind of strange because, this um fifteen this the lines here this fifteen's kind of like we really don't know what that is it could be like i have one friend who speaks English and everyone else speaks language A, or it could be like i have fifteen friends who speak English and one friend who speaks language A so that's that doesn't really tell us much but there are eight people who only have friends basically who speak English so that's that's a pretty large number. who are just not involved basically in a language A community at this point. in terms of their own peers um so. um, okay, my transparencies...          <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="FLIPPING THROUGH TRANSPARENCIES"></EVENT>          okay. so basically my conclusions were that students who are more involved in a bilingual community or who see themselves becoming more involved in it in the future with these kind of imaginary questions, are are also more concerned with maintaining language A, be that Hindi or Spanish or Gujarati or there's um, i guess probably no one in here does Indian languages but i can mention that the different languages i was asked this before so the different languages that they spoke besides Hindi were Marathi Urdu two Gujarati and one Oriya. so there's kind of a wide range of other languages, and Arabic one other spoke Arabic. um, okay so basically there is this high correlation between seeing themselves being involved in this community and wanting to maintain language A. so that sort of says to me there's the language is an important part of their cultural identity and often students when i asked them that i said what is_ what d- does your culture mean to you um outside of the language you know they would kind of say well, there's food and you know there's, you know the religious customs they would often say but beyond that that was kind of it um, there were some other interesting things that came up. um, but in language A the the the language seemed to play a more important part in it. um let's see, and, let's see          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          and i'm sort of wondering and i don't know if i'll be able to answer that in this but i'm i'm sort of wondering what in what way the students hope to retain language A if they're not gonna be involved in the community and then you get into this more symbolic, orientation towards this community. where it's like i want to be whatever an- an Indian American, but um, maybe i'm just tend to spend more time with you know English speaking Americans or, whatever, so that's an interesting question i don't know if i'll get around to that but, it's just a thought for the future. okay, so        </U1>

          point one which means it's important,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          but that does mean i mean there's there was definitely several people in the Spanish sample who just circled five five five five five you know, so you know it does mean that more people were circling four or whatever but not, yeah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> well, it might be subject to that because um, one of my best friends is actually taking this class.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          and she was interviewed.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes </U2>
          and i spend a lot of time with her,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and all the stuff that you were talking about you know it's this whole, pressure to want to become one who belongs in the community, and to actually, feel that at times because she's not as- she doesn't think she's as proficient          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          (then) she might just end up just having this symbolic, baggage (thing.) taking you know (xx) her life that she (xx) become a Sp- Spanish speaker.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but in terms of the academic stuff, it would seem to me that the class actually encour- encourages the students to look at Spanish in a new domain.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          encourages very academically based          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so it would be interesting to actually, perhaps, in another time another          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          place,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> a new world </U2>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH" WHO="SS"></EVENT>          to actually see you know these um language attitudes before the class begins.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right, that would, that would be helpful yeah Jenny mentions </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> for classes like that </OVERLAP1>
          and then, see what happens (with it) because um i do know some people who are just totally amazed that, that they can actually feel like they (can) (xx) (their own) Spanish.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and that they feel validated          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          in that domain.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so maybe there's some- maybe that has something to do with this difference too because i don't think that that's an emphasis in the          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (right no it isn't) (xx) emphasis (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Hindi class and when i asked, </OVERLAP1>
          and when i asked students about that in the interviews um there were m- there were more people i don't_ people didn't mention that they wanted to use it for academics necessarily but but sort of people mentioned for the Spanish that they wanted to use that for work, um when i asked about Hindi i got kind of different answers you know some people would say oh no you don't even need Hindi in in India you can just speak English, um one person said well it'd be nice maybe if i can do business in India which i'm thinking maybe i'll speak Hindi. but that was like one of the (xx) people i um interviewed so maybe that has something to do with the class i'm not sure, um it would be nice to find that out before sample time but um but it's basically, i think it's true though that Spanish is seen as more useful in this country though.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm            <OVERLAP2> right. yeah right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> at least </OVERLAP1>
          professionally i mean i think that's definitely even          <OVERLAP1> without the class </OVERLAP1>

s- and and that (happened) as a result of all this trans- transplantation. as a resort_ as as a as a result of them moving, as soon as you have, um, Anglo speakers and also other Native American communities you have Navajos being transplanted, both forcibly and also in terms of you know in terms of their own desire (xx) wanting that, those um, (dislocations.) um... and and when it and when it come to dealing with Native American languages and Native American speakers in the Southwest, one also has to deal with Chicanos because both of them, Native Americans Chicanos are actually what you consider territorial minorities. they're actually people who if you have to say who were there first. and within those two communities there's a lot of controversy as to who was there first. but we don't want to get into that. we just need to know that um, let me see          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          you have another situation going on is interesting. you have the situation of the Southwe- e- uh Southwest and Mexico. um, several researchers uh researchers including Jane Hill, have uh conducted studies in loan words. and they've found e- that um, you have, you have a considerable degree of um borrowing, um in some Native American languages, um, they've found Nahuatl borrowings. which come from, as early as, you know, i would say even before the conquest. and you still have those remnants which is really interesting, um... what's interesting about the Southwest too in terms of the populations there is that, you don- you don't only have bilingualism you also have trilingualism, which becomes much more, complex in terms of studying, um, those linguistic um, repertoires. um, you have situations where, um usually in terms, there's certain typologies of language contact in native North America but, n- in focusing s- the southwest, you have speakers, who, speakers who are um beyond thirty, usually are bilingual. in both, n- n- bilingual trilingual, um in their Native American language, um Spanish and English and you have speakers who are younger of course usually are much more English dominant. and in this situation you have a situation of um, um this phenomenon called, Indian English. which is uh which is very it's been categorized very similarly to Black English, or Puerto Rican English where you have um certain um phonological um intonational, s- semantic um, similarities from the, from the native language. um, you have this this scholar by the name of William (Leap.) who's actually spent_ he's actually um devoted his his life to um this type of um, of study, and he usually has done it um, he usually has looked at um...

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NRN" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> the whole repertoire what's interesting about it he he he, that's a really good point, he does he does adm- um, he does state that, as there are different types of Englishes you also have different types of Indian English so you have Navajo Indian English you have Hopi Indian English you have Cherokee Indian English. so, one has to also get to know the native language in order to figure what are the similarities and whether they diverge. so i i would say the same thing with Spanish. you have Puerto Rican English and you probably have Colombian English. although, uh depending on the on the contact situation you could have, you could have dialect leveling in that sense too. um, the history about this Indian English is interesting because, by the turn of the century and this was like a, widespread um, um policy for Native Americans, by the turn of the century you have, you had in- um Indian children being forced out of their homes into boarding schools. so you actually have, um kids coming from different s- uh reservations, different places around native America, who actually had a had to deal with each other, and um, and understand each other so English became like a lingua franca. so within that you have that situation going on you also have, in the nineteen fifties the termination policy which actually, um, expelled a lot of the native peoples into the cities and that was another, governmental policy, where you have people also coming from different, um linguistic backgrounds different languages, um, coming together and using English as a lang- lingua franca. but then you have the situation where people become, dominant and people actually, just, using this Indian English. so um there's been some research there's research on that but still it's ongoing          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> mhm </U2>
          because it's still you still have, so many different languages you still, the typology's still not there but uh it's it's a a field that is very very um popular right now.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          and what's interesting about it, i- in the situation is that (this i- this i didn't) find in the literature, if one has Indian English you want s- (you want suppose they have Indian Spanish) but that is not, that really has not been seen in the literature, i mean i think it's to do, you have a question yes        </U1>

(xx) depending on the closeness of the interaction with other Spanish speakers especially Mexican, speakers, you have the much more Spanish dominant. but within that you know you can still talk about Indian Spanish, just the same way you can talk about, you know, the Spanish that Indian Spanish that's influenced by Quechua or you know, other languages Native American languages. so that's that's interesting i guess it's because we are in an English dominant, society academic world so, i'm sure other p- i'm sure people are studying that too. um... let's see what else i can, tell you guys. there's there's been one, interesting study and it's it's finally, we probably will be very appreciative of it. has to do with um, with uh Susan Phillip's study in nineteen seventy-two, of this um war- Warm Springs um Indian um classroom, where she actually um, studies the interactio- the interactional dynamics of um Indian children. and how they use they use silence, how they use, how they use, uh the notion of uh of group solidarity, to actually both both um, create a solidarity and also separate themselves from others. so you have you that and i believe that she, um used a little bit of the (xx) approach but not, the way that we've been doing it much more (xx) and this is kind of like a a a very um, good field to get into because um, one of the one of the biggest biggest urgencies in terms of this research is educational educational um um, stuff. um we have in terms of Indian English you have, the same old thing about the literature by semil- semiling- lingual speakers, the same things is appro- is is attributed to um Indian English speakers. um, and you also have the whole situation not just linguistic and this is interesting too it's like not just, y- you, the the um, the person, specially the academic child is not just a a linguistic person in terms of um speaking. (actor.) but also you have the, the situation of gestures. how gestures are read. are read by the people, in authority and how gestures can vary, cross-culturally. </U1>

          but let's see if we, we_ we can, make it together. okay, first thing to start with is talking about the, terminology, because when we talk about bilingual first language acquisition, uh Koeppe and Meisel, these authors that are by the way German working at the University of Hamburg, they refer to children as opposed to, an acquiring two, or more languages simultaneously before age three and this is very important because, we've seen the differences before. so (there's) simultaneously, both languages at the same time, before the age three. and these children could have lived in one or the other country, by th- until the a- age three comes. um, what they talk about is bilingual code-switching, which is governed by grammatical and pragmatic constraints which means that code-switchers, are required to have pragmatic and grammatic, and grammatic competence, grammatical competence in both languages. um, but what happens with infants is that sometimes bilingual children use both languages, in the same utterance or a conversation, and they violate syntactic or grammatic constraints of code-switching, this is what they call code-mixing. and, it can be accounted, for by the failure in separating the two linguistic systems, that's what is called fusion, due either to the lack of lang- of knowledge of syntactic and pras- pragmatic constraints, or also could be to the lack of, the necessary elements to which the constraints applies, or maybe both. so there's, one thing they're gonna have a look into. um, important point is to determine from what age children organize language by grammatical means. and also, um the distinction between different categories of words and having these two elements, um, counting for their, study, helps them to distinguish code-mixing code-mixing from code-switching, in early child language. so it depends really, on, from what age onward children organize language and when are they really, using their syntactic knowledge or not so that's that's really important for this distinction between code-switching and code-mixing. and what Koeppe and Meisel do is um, comprehensive literature review about code-switching acquisition, and they, they say that these studies are mainly referred to longitudinal studies on bilingual language acquisition which typically, concern a linguistic environment, where each person speaks one language. so in all these situations so one parent one language, or child_ children speaking one language in the home and then one language outside of the home, they said that most studies, they referred to this. which is true i've seen that here in class. um, they divide their, their studies in two, um main (tracks) like we've seen before one is the pragmatic functions of code-switching and the other one is the syntactic aspects of language mixing. and, starting with the pragmatic functions we've seen two, two types in class do you remember which one they were? do you_ can you, just more or less a rough idea wha- which two aspects big aspects talking about the pragmatic functions of code-switching that we've seen in class?        </U1>

          and we'll see some examples for that. um, with respect to the syntactic aspects of language mi- mixing, uh Koeppe and Meisel they gathered the, the literature, about, the studies that they, they're concerned with language mixing and language separation, the problem is, most of the studies find out that the mixings are very low, we've seen this in class as well. this is m- mainly repetition of many things that we've seen so far it's a bit of, um, sum- summarizing. what is necessary is to relate mixing rates to polititive aspects, of language for instance which categories are mixed, the structure of condition for switching how developed is the child, is the child's grammatical competence etcetera. and also to pragmatic functional considerations, are these mixes conscious? do they respect social rules of language use? is the addressee bilingual...? the distinction between different categories of word mix, helps to distinguish code-mixing from code-switching in early child language so we need to distinguish which categories have been mixed, to start with, and empirical studies have shown that in early stages children mix function words, what are function words? do you all know? can somebody explain that?        </U1>

          he corrects himself he says no no no, no, uh bread no no e- what i mean is like, what you ea- to eat, so he corrects himself, so he's aware, of the switch in languages of the the person he's talking to... and they're self-initiated switches he, um, it came from from himself. there's an example number three with Annika when she corrects her errors and adopts different strategies to avoid errors, or when she uses the incorrect language. um, the German, mm interviewer says          <EVENT DESC="READING FROM HANDOUT"></EVENT>         <FOREIGN> Annika hat uns gerade erzahlt das sie selber der osterhase ist, </FOREIGN>

          is_          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          we have it between the, uh the determiner and the noun,          <FOREIGN> nounours sand </FOREIGN>

          oh, excuse me, no no, yes f- no this this is, this is in Ivar's but it's it's earlier and later on he does it from two five he doesn't do it anymore, this is what he used to do it          <FOREIGN> nounours il a reite </FOREIGN>

          so it's uh, just the word          <FOREIGN> kuche </FOREIGN>
          kitchen inserted there, uh, and like i said before Annika's data is con- contradicting Ivar's data she uses the switch within sentences with omitted elements at a later er- age. when she was already four years old like we can see in example eight she's saying          <FOREIGN> il a gewonnen </FOREIGN>
          and also          <FOREIGN> ca c'est Daniels </FOREIGN>
          we talked about this in class she's, given the word_ what do we call uh, gen- what the genitive in German she's attaching that to a French in a French sentence. and i've s- observed that in Spanish speakers s- Spanish English bilinguals they do that, i've -served that at age of two two. and, at the age of three seven it's supposed to be, eradicated but, Annika said it.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH" WHO="SS"></EVENT>          so... Koeppe and Meisel attributed that probably to performant errors because this type of data was infrequent they said.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH" WHO="SS"></EVENT>          the problems they said well if our theory, is consistent, then it's impossible that at this age she has not acquired syntactic regularities that means it must be performant errors and then we wash our hands and save ourselves        </U1>
       <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> well a lot of people think that code-mixing is a performance phenomenon,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm </U2>
          you know i- i don't know if you've discussed this with San,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> um </U2>
          or with          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> anybody, </OVERLAP1>
          but, uh this is the huge problem and this is why, if you use variable constraints in fact it at least accounts for the data but it still, doesn't tell you what's happening underlyingly.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="SPA"> mhm. yeah that's the most difficult thing          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE"> mhm </U2>
          to see, um, well continuing, almost finished, um on the basis of quan- qualitative and quantitative changes it seems to be two stages of syntactical development in children according to all this data and, um, and one will be characterized by the absence of the functional category infi- INFL the infla- inflection, which doesn't appear to be syntactically, constrained the the utterances that that means this co- code-mixing we talked about, and around the age of two and half, children stop mixing function words and rarely violate syntactic constraints on code-switching of the type Poplack, uh presented and this coincides with the emergence of the functional category INFL. which seems to account for qualitative ch- changes in the child's speech by the transition from mixing function words to lexical categories nouns and the ability to respect grammatical constraints in code-switching. in Annika's data, from age two six onwards most of her mix- mixes seems to concern single nouns inserted and the switch, um, at the switch point dertermina- determiner noun like the ones we've seen, before. and if we see this um, um, tables, we can see the tendency the the utterances in German what he says, um, total mix_ we can say we can go for the percentages maybe it's the easiest percentages of mix for German utterances and for French utterances, we can see that, there, tend to disappear towards age three, and we compare, mm Ivar and Annika Annika is, two eleven she's practically also three. and if we take the very last two columns in both um, tables, we can see the function and lexical percentages          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NSO" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="UKE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> for the </OVERLAP1>
          switches, and they're, they're going, the functional they're disappearing, whereas the lexical are present. there so hundred percent, from age, three five, approximately for one child and, yeah two six for the other, there's a clear separation. and we can see that all switches are lexical and function switc- functional, switches functional word switches are are gone. which this uh, corroborates, with the first assumption and other, other authors' um hypothesis too. uh the conclusion, is that changes in formal properties of the mixed speech of bilingual children are related to grammatical developments.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          the the completion. the appearance of the functional category INFL again accounts for changes in code-switching. the development of pragmatic function however the the the doesn't seem to observe grammatical constraints, they're separate things after all, although they're inter-related, but we're talking about different things, pragmatic (aspects of) code-switching are influenced by several factors of language use in the family the parents expectations, about language choice and also the reactions to code-switching. um, which may contribute to the separation of languages and the development of specific strategies to help (avoiding) mixing like with Annika, (xx) points for further investigation, uh will be, to have a look at the causes of early mixing, are they pragmatic motivations for mixing of function words or does this kind of mixing indicate fusion of both language systems, this eternal conflict between, are they two separate systems from the beginning or only one? and i think this is still under debate. and also correlations between grammatical developments and formal aspects of language mixing, are they really universal? and that's why, Koeppe and Meisel suggest that, it would be interesting to analyze the the speech of more children acquiring different languages with respect to these questions. and that's where, this study i've talked about before Elizabeth Lanza, she she does thi- this kind of study with Norwegian and English, and she said that it doesn't hold out this, k- this Koeppe and Meisel what, they, they found out it doesn't hold up, their in her, uh informants, there're changes there're different, um, well results, with respect to this analysis. and, she found out that that her informants mixed function words until the age of two seven. so it's a lot later than than (xx)        </U1>
