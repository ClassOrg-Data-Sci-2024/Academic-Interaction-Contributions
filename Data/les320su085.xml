          now let me tell you why, it's called the Bearded, well it's bearded, the slave is bearded, um, it is an unfinished sculpture by Michelangelo and lemme write this name on the board. and i'm pretty sure you can          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          Michelangelo. and you can just call it a Boboli slave, and the reason is          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh Boboli </U2>
          yeah Boboli. the reason is because the slaves ar- wer- are owned by the Boboli family. that's w- they're an Italian family rich family, the Bobolis, there's a Boboli if you go to um, if you go to Florence there's a Boboli Gardens, also, in association with that family. now the thing about this, this wonderful um, Boboli slave is that it is, it is unfinished. and so what we get to do is we get to actually see Michelangelo at work. this is a way of really getting into the process, of how this in- extraordinary sculpture works. but it also illustrates, a real problem of um, of subtractive sculpture, of of the use of carving. and that is, that, when the sculptor gets a block of marble, which this material is or a block of stone, they have to gauge exactly, the proportions they have to kind of understand, how they're going to work not only um from top to bottom but in three dimensions. and if you have a figure that's not like this, right? if you have a figure that's that's twisted or turned or whatever, um, you ca- you you can't, be absolutely sure that you've got it right. d- can you imagine that? can you imagine what he's having to do what he's trying to do? well, he, abandoned work on The Boboli Slaves because he really felt that it just didn't wor- it he, he couldn't, he couldn't get that figure out of this, the s- the marble, he had to take away, things from the marble, but he just, he couldn't imagine actually finishing it. can you see, how the proportions would be a problem here, if he were to continue on with this carving?

          cuts, yeah. the Durer flagellation that we looked at last time. it's really analogous to that. you've gotta have it, on the ball. you really have to, because once you slip or make a mistake, you're in deep, doo-doo. no but, if you don't, if you can't um, finish it up, and even such artists as Michelangelo, did screw-up. um, what happens is that um, what usually happens in the first stage though, of carving on stone which is really difficult, i mean, we we talked about how difficult it is to get that little detail um in when you're doing wood c- when you're doing wood carving, and then also when you're doing engraving well, here you've got to imagine that you need to have, at least with with with Durer he had a little, knife, you know what i mean? he had a little knife and he was managing it with his hand right? and and and when he did etchings he was managing it again with his hand and his fingers, he had control over this part of his arm. now this is heavy labor. so um, to carve stone especially stone of this size, we're not talking about a Venus of Willendorf size stone which is, uh you can hold in your hand, here we're talking about, a block of marble that's bigger than the artist. right? so these are these are more than life size. and, in order to get down i- you know down into it, you've gotta do this really heavy labor, you've gotta do a lot of chipping and um, hammering, um, wait lemme make sure i've told you, all the different, so the first thing that you have to do is you have to kind of hew out a rough shape, and what you can see is, that here's the rough shape that he's worked at, but you can also see how he's done it. you know it's a really labor intensive process because, you can't just, cut away, you know what i mean? think of a block of marble, you have to kind of take um, you have to take tools and hammer, and chip, away the marble. you see it? and you can what you can do is you can actually see, Michelangelo working here, on the marble, um, in various ways and you can see how, this is the, this was the original very rough hewn, block right? and then he goes in closer and he starts doing detail, and then then his strokes have to become finer and finer. now what i'd like you to do, is to all come up to see this because, you need to see the different um, the different kinds of textures that come when you're doing, rough labor and hi- and fine, chipping. you know what i mean? and you can see that right here. you can see, all this stuff, right around here look look in here and wha- get get in close and take a look at the um, detail, now and then take a look at this, area so you can get a sense of what's going on. so just come on up. come, on either side and don't block the light and (xx)          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          did you see it?        </U1>

Michelangelo really wanted to finish this thing. he likes carving much better than painting, but he got stuck for forty-eight doing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. so, here again you can get it can you see the detail here?          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          here's the detail of a head, and you can really see that kind of fine, chipping away... Michelangelo said that he when he when he looked at blocks of stone he really um, he had to choose a block of stone and then discover the figure inside of it. but these guys didn't get, discovered. or they kinda got half discovered. you can see these if you go to Florence, in Italy, and see them they're at the Academia which is the sculpture, one of the places where you can see sculpture, in Florence. okay, let's look at a finished Michelangelo sculpture so that we can make the comparison, between, an unfinished and finished and see, how, refined his surfaces became.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>       </U1>

          in the in the nineteenth century although, there were lots there were lots of, additive sculptures sculptures before that. but i'm gonna show you the example an example from the nineteenth century          <PAUSE DUR=":17" ></PAUSE>          take the (xx) this is by the nineteenth century sculptor Rodin R O D I N          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          and let's talk a little bit about how this demonstrates a- the additive, process. first of all you start um, by not taking away but by what's called modelling. um you add to rather than take away, you use malleable plastic material such as clay wax or plasticine which is clay mixed with wax and mineral oil, um, and that allows the artist really great freedom in building up and modifying the form. modelling is a lot, is really in some ways analogous to oil painting. you uh, have a chance, to fuss around with it you can change it you can, you know you can, you've got you've got time to work with this stuff, um, and mold it. um it takes another kind of strength but it doesn't have it doesn't, you know one thing about the modelling process actually i'll ask you if you can figure this out. one, what is the difference between, the tools that you would use for modelling, and, the tools that you would use for carving, and how does that affect how the artist does things? what do you get to do when you model? you've all modeled clay right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> your hands yeah. and that makes a huge difference. the hands and what the hands, um, can do in fact if you look, closely on this you can actually see, the way you can on some oil painting when we looked at the Monet you can see the hands of the artist imprinted, in what used to be the clay and, let's see if we can,          <OVERLAP1> get you to come up close. </OVERLAP1>

A R M A T U R E an armature which means that you have some kind of a support system, on which you can build the clay and lemme show you, i'll show you an armature, here. here's a sculpture that you co- where you, actually can see the armature. there. this is a sculpture by Degas, which is, Degas the French, impressionist painter which never got finished, but you can see that he had um, that he was building up his clay around this armature. do you see that? and then there's the the strut. so he would've had one um he would've had one in the leg and one in the leg and this would've probably had, an armature as well.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so would he, would he uh, would he have have ended up cutting that hole that's sticking into her hip away? </U1>

          on your, your ri- left. you're seeing the plaster mold, that Rodin used to cast, uh his final bronze project, his final bronze sculpture. so, and you know what casting is. do you know what casting is?          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          Taylor explains it, it's you give shape to a substance by pouring in in a liquid or plastic form into a mold and letting it harden. so molten bronze is poured into this, into this mold and then it's left to harden and then the plaster is, chipped away and you have um, you have your you have your sculpture. so lemme show you the, the finished product here.        </U1>
