       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's in class just like last time, yeah.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, right </U2>
          so we're gonn- we're gonna go over a lot of stuff and a lot of material. try to help y'all out a little bit.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> instead of saying, we can't answer that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, okay, so,          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> shit </U2>
          let's start.          <EVENT DESC="SIGHS"></EVENT>          this is the, like, such a cool thing if you have the right attitude about it, alright? these, the first thing to think about is that this is a mammalian brain. and, mammalian brains are fundamentally, and structurally, incredibly similar. what you are about to see is, in most ways that really matters, not very much different from what you see in in human brains. it's a lot smaller, and there's a lot of stuff that's less well uh, developed. but for the most part everything that's structured in this brain, humans have as well. they just have bigger or smaller versions of 'em. and, one of the things that you're gonna wanna do, is, one of the things- you- you're i definitely want you to see is that the cortex itself, in terms of its organization is pretty homogenous, and not very interesting. but, on the other side of the cortex, underneath the cortex, there's all this cool stuff. and that's really what you want to get at. get at it from underneath the cortex. things like the fornix, right? which is attached to the cingulate gyrus or the corpus callosum which is here. then goes underneath it's a myelinated sheath which seems to be involved in the organization of emotional, patterns. um midbrain structures, like, the hippocampus, which if you guys can find, is really really cool. i'll give ya_ i'll hel- i'll try to help you find it, but it's organized, basically underneath the temporal lobe, which is here. okay? these are all not cortical they're underneath the cortex. so, after you, do the work that's in here, think about the the the uh midbrain and the, hindbrain structures. and then all the stuff that's happening in, the brain stem, like the pons. um, the thalamus should be very easy to find. so will the inferior and superior colliculi okay? they're they're actually very very obvious. and the, the cerebellum. what i would recommend you do, is, take half your bra- you go- you got two halves of your brain right? take half your brain and take it through that step-by-step process that's on the sheet in front of you. and that will take you all the way to uh, pretty much like basically early subcortical, examination. take the other half of your brain, and dig around. try to find the stuff that that you that you think might actually be very very interesting that's actually in the book. and in particular, think about it in in terms of this context. the cortex itself, is really only about an eighth of an inch thick. okay? everything underneath the cortex is, uh connections, to other cortical areas, and midbrain hindbrain areas. so the things that you find underneath the cortex really will tell you a whole lot about how the brain's put together and how it works. wow. okay. it's gonna hafta be four to a brain. dissection sheets are over here. alright. okay. we, we've procured some incredibly high technology,          <EVENT WHO="S5" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          plastic knives, nice.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> no way </U2>
          okay, gloves are over here. okay, we have some like, really high-tech instruments designed to cut your brains up, alright? we also have some metal spat- metal spatulas, it doesn't matter. as a matter of fact, i recommend you use these, because it, it gives you a better cut, and they're lighter. it it- you- it's easier to control control the cut. um, these brains have been, uh stored in formaldehyde so they're a lot harder than they normally would be. if you took a brain like this from a sheep, you know if you were hunting down sheep one night and you, caught a sheep, and you pulled the brain out it would actually be very squishy and and very very uh, easy to damage. what happened with these, is that they were put in formaldehyde and they were soaked, so they've been basically hardened and solidified. that being said it's a very soft tissue. this is all you're gonna need. okay? this is all you're gonna need. you might wanna use two, but you should be able to do everything you need to do with fingers. and with with the butter knives. so, come on up, grab yourself a ins- implement of destruction.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we need tweezers? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> tweezers are cool, for pulling away some of the smaller parts, and everyone's in- every group should try to have some.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh? </U2>
          okay?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> now you go out and sell (underwear) again (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i know </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... follow the, basically follow the dissection process step by step. i wanna reiterate, this is a, teaching technique, this is a pedagogical method for you guys, to learn, where, the parts of brain are. i don't care what your brain looks like at the end of this.          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i heard some chemist was telling me some story about some pig that she was dissecting all semester and if she messed up the brain she got points off. i don't care, okay? what matters to me is that you use this to help you, on the exam, which comes in two weeks because i guarantee that there's gonna be anatomical questions on the exam in two weeks, alright? just take my word for it. just count on that. so um, have some fun with this, use it to to find the parts that're in here, and then dig around a little bit. if you have questions about a particular uh, organ or nucleus, see if you can find it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hey tell me about the pineal gland. wh- what exactly does the pineal gland what does          <OVERLAP1> (what does the pineal gland do) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> the pineal gland </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's in the hindbrain,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it's </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the pineal gland is it's really only interesting if you're into, uh, uh          <OVERLAP1> (property dualism, which is Cartesian) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well because Descartes thought that consciousness can't (do anything) </U1>

          what you do, what you should be able to find too is, let me see, well look at that. maybe you guys do have that.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> as in, olfactory? </U2>
          that, that looks like the olfactory bulb to me.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and what's the other one on_ the matching one on the other side?          <OVERLAP1> is that an optic nerve? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> uh well there're there're </OVERLAP1>
          two of them. right? there're two olfactory bulbs, so there's one on each side.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh really? </U2>
          yeah. and here's uh, now here's, here's a thinker for you (Rick.) the olfactory bulb. you know the optic chiasm is a cross-over, right? and what's happening there is that basically in the uh, the reason for that is because you know right hemisphere controls left side of brain          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, right </U2>
          olfactory systems are not like that. olfactory systems are what you call ipsilateral.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yeah </U2>
          this is contralateral.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          ipsilateral. and so, when you see this, you see the way it kinda goes with the brain there.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i have a question, when, when you're looking for the occipital lobes.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          does it matter, when you look at the frontal lobe. is it just an area?          <OVERLAP1> or is it like </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's just it's area </OVERLAP1>
          i mean, it's supposed          <OVERLAP1> be divided (into) central sulcus </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> (cuz they always in all the diagrams they always) point to </OVERLAP1>
          a specific, area        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i mean it's hard to find. like, the central sulcus is supposed to be right about, here. actually you can see          <OVERLAP1> it on this one really nice </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and the sulcus </OVERLAP1>
          that's like another just word for what? like a          <OVERLAP1> canal basically, it's not a structure it's just a differentiated </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> sulcus means, yeah sulcus is a is a um is </OVERLAP1>

          yeah, and and so here's your central sulcus. here's your frontal lobe there's your parietal lobe and there's your occipital lobe back here. so this division here, should tell you what you're (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and temporal temporal parietal that difference is there something          <OVERLAP1> that separates those two? </OVERLAP1>

          the way you think about it. think about the brain as a fist          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and the thumb is the is the temporal lobe          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and then you have your occipital lobe here. and the frontal lobe. so. the temporal lobe sort of folds underneath from the other cortex.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. </U2>
          (xx)        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. now imagine like with humans, it would look like this, right? which is why we w- w- confused wi- with, animals, yeah it's like straight back so this is superior inferior colliculi. now, what you're supposed to be able to do if you cut right through the middle of this, is find the substantia nigra but i i haven't found (anybody can) do it. um okay          <EVENT WHO="S8" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you can do it, alright. so th- this is a good example. you see that the thalamus, which was, here, right? and then the hypothalamus was here. and then you have this_ this is real- i have no idea what exactly this, object right here is.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> red stuff? </U2>
          no this this this big old pumping, uh nucleus right here, it's got it's got          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> a lot of veins in it (xx) </OVERLAP2>

          yeah if you, pull away this stuff here, let me show you something. this is really tough cuz it's (hypolaminated,) but if you pull this away, you get, you see this? you see all the, you see the little stripes, the little lines there?          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah (xx) </U2>
          that is, all fibers. that's all nerve fibers. i don't know what that is. um, i think, i think, it's like, basically, i mean this may actually be a thalamus and this may be the hypothalamus, and in which case, you know like all this crap we've been doing before is is wrong i've been told wrong all these years. it makes more sense because this is a big old object that has a whole lot of nerve fibers extending from it and there's a smaller object beneath it. but, whatever it is it's really interesting because of all the uh, all the          <OVERLAP1> nerve fibers </OVERLAP1>
