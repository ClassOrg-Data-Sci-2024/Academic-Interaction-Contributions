       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> Kelly. i'm sure half of you will delete this before reading it, but i just wanted to say that i (xx yesterday with a tear in my eye)          <EVENT WHO="S12" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          most people watching that movie particularly because, he has so many nonactors, there are so many people who were there. what happened was, during the shooting of the, the movie, people passed and they saw the sign. even though they knew it was, the shooting of a feature film, they hoped that, she would really write the letters and give to them and they would get the chance to mail to their loved ones, so as you probably, may have noticed, some of the people truly looked like they were not actors they were just there, opening their hearts they were just saying it and sending a message hoping that they would send a message to a loved one. and at the opening of the film, she they_ the premiere was at that city. so they went there and the people who had invaded the homes like they mentioned that that had really been invaded, they came to her and said that the mayor still hadn't given them electricity. so she went to him and said how come? you promised me when we were here. so there is a lot of um, participation of, the real people from the region. that's what made the movie special, particularly to Brazilians who knew the behind-the-scenes stories. s- and it was nominated for an Oscar it, didn't win but Life Is Beautiful it's, was a good movie too so. i don't know if um, it's working (well.) in the meantime, we can, this here, one of the question this is from Robert from Kevin. Kevin had asked,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> how has the media reached the individuals living in the deepest part of the Amazon? are they beginning to try to modernize every, every part of the country? </SEG>
          anyone would like to try to answer that...? this is a, question that Kevin asked.          <SEG TYPE="READING"> how has the media reached individuals, living in the deepest part of the Amazon? </SEG>
          remember that we saw the Avon lady etcetera etcetera in that documentary. anyone would have from future, presentations anyone would have, any input or any information? i don't wanna answer if it is something that is part of your presentation. yes Betty?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well didn't we, learn in like one of the videos like, um T-V is just universal down there, like everyone has one and it's just like all linked together? and so that's how like, people even in the deepest regions can stay in contact. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> it was part of a government, um campaign it was party of the government, plot or, goals, to unite the country. what they wanted were was to have, every single citizen or as many as possible even in the jungle, to have access to T-V, and that was how they spread their, propaganda. it was during the dictatorship. they worked in partnership with Globo which is considered the fourth, largest T-V network in the world. and, the government wanted to show the P-S-As and, documentaries and, T-V ads etcetera, and even soap operas. they were all part of the, uh government plan, to, introduce information that it would benefit the, um government goals and plans. that's why even in the jungle when they didn't have, electricity the government would provide electricity, and buy even if only one T-V set and put in the center of the square and people would come in the evenings and watch T-V. maybe some of you who've had Kottak's anthropology class have heard about that? i remember someone early in the semester men- me- mentioning anthropology. but um, the T-V had a, very, i- it was, it was part of the government's, um plan, to communicate so brought T-V even to Indian villages etcetera. if you guys, are ready is it working Bruce?          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah. it's            <OVERLAP2> ready to go </OVERLAP2>

Amazon. make Brazil one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Brazilians are friendly, warm and happy people. above all they are free-spirited and resent being told what to do. Brazilians are gregarious, outgoing, and love to be around people. the hot climate allows them to spend a great deal of time outdoors, often just chatting with friends or watching people. this seems like an ideal place. however there is much that is less than ideal happening beneath the surface. the prison and law enforcement systems appear certainly less than ideal. torture happens often, and methods of interrogation are frequently inhumane... two women, Marlie and Rosanna, were tortured and sexually assaulted, by civil police when they were interrogated in connection with a murder. the women were taken to a police station and subjected to two days of torture. when Marlie refused to sign a confession, a police officer slapped her on both ears. another policemen then hit her on the soles of her feet, and palms of her hand with a long strip of rubber, cut from a car tire. the police officers both lowered their trousers and rubbed their penises in the face of Marlie who was handcuffed. the couple says this treatment continued for two days, during which they were not permitted to drink, eat, wash, or have contact with a lawyer. the police allegedly also asked for bribes. when they were finally allowed to wash under a water pipe, it was in the presence of a policeman and male prisoners. when they were finally transferred to the women's prison, staff noted their visible injuries and tried to persuade them to have a medical examination, however they refused. because in order to get to the Forensic Medical Institute, they would have had to travel with a police escort made up of the same police who had tortured them. in a hearing before the judge, the couple alleged ill treatment by the police, but the judge has not taken steps to investigate their allegations of torture, despite the existence of a medical report, and eyewitness testimony to their injuries by prison staff. no action has been taken against the policemen involved either. public prosecutors from the court that oversees prison sentences, discovered a range of instruments in a small bathroom in the ground floor of the prison, known to be used for torture sessions. these included wet towels, which are placed over the victim's head, electrical devices from which bare wires protruded for applying electric shocks, and a metal bar, from which victims are suspended upside down by their ankles and wrists. how could any human treat another in such an inhumane way? what is this all about? law enforcement agents are supposed to serve and protect citizens, not rape, beat, torture, and abuse them. the mindset of an individual who feels it necessary or even justifiable to make another human feel less than human is tragic. torture and beatings are an unnecessary part of life. no man deserves to be treated as subordinate. these practices must stop.        </U1>
       <EVENT DUR=":04" WHO="SS" DESC="APPLAUSE"></EVENT>       <PAUSE DUR=":14" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay um i'm going to talk about the the political, um corruption, that happens in Brazil, and relate it to the, the stor- history, of corruption.          <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"></EVENT>          um, Brazil is the largest nation, in South America, and the third world's most populous democracy. political leaders have always faced challenges in ruling Brazil because of its immense size and population. ever since the conquest corruption has been the norm among politicians. because Brazil has been slower to make political changes than the rest of Latin America, it is harder to find similari- similarities between it, and Spanish America. for example, while the Spanish nations were becoming independent through revolutions, Brazil was being ruled by a Portuguese emperor. also, contrary to the majority of Spanish America, slavery was abolished in the late eighteen hundreds, a hundred years after the rest of Spanish America. this might explain the more prominent gap, between the rich and the poor, as the former black slaves, are a majority population of poor, and the white, rich elite, and politicians, are the minority, of wealthy. through the many political regimes, there seems to be a pr- pattern of wealthy, oligarchy controlling, a nation through corruption. through the corrupt military regime_ though the corrupt military regime is over, the democratic state of Brazil, is the democratic state of Brazil immune to the traditional corruption? many scholars believe that the political system needs to be reformed because the corruption is still a prevalent problem. for instance, politicians, can easily partake in corruption because many of them stay in office, for one or less terms. even if they were to stay in office longer, there are ways to get around scandals. one of the most used methods is through the corrupt judiciary system. though Brazil's constitution imitates the U-S one, there are many inconsistencies. the court system, is supposed to balance the power of the Congress and executive branch. but if all are corrupt, how can the corruption be eliminated? as for the political candidates, how can the people elect a politician, when the campaigns are based on personality and not ability? yes the people have the right to vote, but is there really an honest politician to choose from? many believe that the current President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is the one to break the chain, of corrupt politicians. however recently a scandal arose, involving him and a Cayman Islands bank account, holding, three hundred and sixty-eight million dollars. luckily the documents claiming this turned out to be false. nevertheless Cardoso's predessor, predecessor, Fernando Collor, was removed from office, in nineteen ninety-two, because of a real corruption scandal. another more recent scandal of corruption dealt with the murder of a judge, who attempted to expose his fellow judges, to the Brazilian Senate. he claimed that some of them received bribes, were receiving bribes from drug traffickers, to reduce their sentences. and others were involved in embezzling, court funds. at least in reaction to all of this people are beginning to recognize the corruption in Brazilian courts. however does this mean, change is like- likely to conquer (a cure?) or will this incident be forgotten? the good news is that President Cardoso appears to be a good politician. unlike those before him he has maintained his office position, for more than a term. and although he faces great economic social and political changes, that stem from centuries of corruption, he may be starting a trend of anticorruption, as he seeks the necessary reforms.        </U1>

       <PAUSE DUR=":15" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. well, welcome to health care in Brazil.          <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"></EVENT>          um, first of all Brazil ranks fourth in the world in the number of AIDS cases so this should give you, a little bit of, an idea about the quality of health care in, Brazil.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          um, now the h- public health care system in Brazil suffers from, uh two things lack of money, and unequal regional distribution of services. now there is money to be spent, and um, like Carol uh pointed out there's a lot of corruptness in the political, uh realm circle in Brazil, and so what happens is the little that is spent whether they hoard it or not,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          uh you might see a lot of politicians playing golf, um, stuff like that, possibly. um, but anyways little of it is spent and it's not spent well in fact in nineteen ninety-two a stat says that uh, Brazilian government spent roughly fifty dollars per person on health care per year. in the United States that's gonna get us maybe an immunization shot,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          for whatever hepatitis flu. um compare this with our own country the United States which is a mediocre health care spender, and uh w- our country spends, uh two thousand eight hundred and forty dollars per person, per year. so um quite a, drastic change in fact fifty-six times um more than Brazil. um, now the benefits of um, Brazil's improving health care system, um have unfortunately been shared unequally by, both region and class. again the south is the richer, area, in Brazil,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          where Sao Paulo is.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          um there's gonna be more, uh, more, buildings more hospitals better quality hospitals, um so people in the south are gonna, you know have more access to better health care. um also um, in terms of class, the rich class have, um, much more, access to better health care systems for example say the president of a business, or say a high C-E-O is gonna, h- he's gonna be um, he's gonna have available to him say uh, an ambulance,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          top class physicians, maybe even a helicopter          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm, mhm </U2>
          where as a person below him, let's take out the helicopter right? um, he's gonna have, you know, physicians maybe not the top physicians he's gonna have an ambulance, but um exclude the helicopter and the best physicians, and it's kind of a hierarchy that goes down to the poor class, basically the poor get nothing. um, now we'll move on to AIDS in Brazil, um, like we mentioned in that first quote, um at which the health care system is directly responsible for, um, Marshall C Eakin um, says there are two, two main factors that have facilitated the spread of AIDS. um the first is the poorly regulated blood supply, um transfusions etcetera, um Bruce could you just scroll down a bit. um there's a quote, um that said in nineteen eight-seven twenty percent of all cases, were reportedly contacted through blood transfusions. compare that with the United States and Europe of one to two percent. that is incredible.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          i think one to two percent, i- is too high. um you know i wouldn't wanna go in for a blood transfusion and you know          <SIC> contact </SIC>
          AIDS so,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          that's, that's kinda a- that's too bad and it's a shame. um the second factor is, um just the inability of the health care system, to, you know adequately, hold these people, um what happens is you have overflows there's not enough beds. so they get discarded,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          into the streets um basically they become outcasts of society and again we go back to the hierarchy it's all the poor people that get thrown out first          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          so what happens is, whether it be drugs needles, they just it's a vicious cycle they continue to spread the virus, um, now uh we can move into abortion. um in Brazil, um, illegal abortion has become a, increasing problem. according to          <SIC> Myron </SIC>
          Eakin uh          <SEG TYPE="READING"> sexual promiscuity and traditional patriarchal politics combine, to result in a vast amount of illegal abortions </SEG>
          so basically there's a lot of people in Brazil, who wanna have sex, and, the male dominated political realm, doesn't care about um females', health issues or their health rights. so they don't care to make it legal, um, get into that in a little bit. um, so uh what happens is many th- of the, of the abortions in Brazil are performed in back alleys um, in fly-by-night clinics, um obviously they're unsanitary and they're very dangerous and it's led to the hospitalization of over four hundred thousand women, and the deaths of nearly four hundred women in Brazil. um, now, back to the hierarchy of class. the rich women, they have access to information w- of whereabouts, the good clinics are. um, where they can receive a, physician, underground so to speak and um they also have the money to do it so the poor, are left with, you know paying two hundred dollars for a barber, you know, to, basically          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> cut them up. </OVERLAP1>
          so um, you know that's basically, the gist of that. um Eakin concludes,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> it's clear that this human tragedy should be blamed primarily on, political culture dominated by men who have shown little concern for women's issues. </SEG>
          um now the economics of abortion i'm taking uh, Economics one-oh-one here microeconomics and we have this uh kind of, supplementary book, and it there was a section on abortion and i just want to share a little bit of that with you in the nineteen seventies the United States, legalized abortion. and what this did was, a lot of the physicians who were scared, to perform the abortions prior to that, came out. now, we start getting more and more of those physicians you know as it goes from the seventies to the eighties to the nineties, um that increases, um actually decreases the health concerns or health, um, the dangers in the health um,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> for that, </OVERLAP1>
          and what happens is economically when you have, more firms or more, um people in a market what's gonna happen is competition's gonna increase, so the price is gonna lower so now many more women, are able to get these abortions in the United States and in fact now, and this quote is from, uh the middle nineteen nineties um nearly, all health related problems have ceased, in the United States, um regarding abortions. so, this could be a po- possible um, solution to Brazil's, illegal abortions problem and um, as a closing statement in the words of Leslie German, uh in Brazil          <SEG TYPE="READING"> if Brazil wants to keep uh help its poor, it will have to change its health care system. </SEG>
          and that's health care.        </U1>
       <EVENT DUR=":04" WHO="SS" DESC="APPLAUSE"></EVENT>       <PAUSE DUR=":12" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="JU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. um, i'm gonna talk about the Univers- okay d- first of all do you_ have any of you heard about the Universal Decala- Declaration of Human Rights?          <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"></EVENT>          well, Brazil happens to be a signatory, of this declaration, along with a whole b- um, other countries, and the main purpose of this Universal Declaration of Human Rights is to give citizens of Brazil, and other countries fundamenta- fundamental rights which they deserve. for example Article One states, that          <SEG TYPE="READING"> all human beings are born free and equal in rights and dignity. </SEG>
          unfortunately, there are examples of when human rights of individuals and social groups, have been violated in Brazil. so then who defends the human rights of these minority groups and indivi- individuals? and who ensures that this declaration will be enforced? the human rights defenders risk their lives, safety, and peace of mind to defend others. human rights defenders vary from everyday citizens to state officials. often these people, are subjected to threats, intimidation and even death squads. and i have two examples, of how these defenders, um, have been intimidated. this is a, example of intimidation. um human rights activists Mato Grosso do Sul, um Gi- Giselle Marques de Carvalho Fontoura and Andenilso does Santos Assuncao and other staff members of a Human Rights Center          <FOREIGN> Centro de Defesa dos Direitos Humanos, Marcal de Souza Tupa-y </FOREIGN>
          began, receiving death threats in October in nineteen ninety-seven, after the discovery of a cemetery that possibly contained rema- remains, of um, death squad, vis- victims. allegedly, these people were killed by policemen, from the Frontier Operations Department. Andenilso dos San- Santos Assuncao, researched the killings and disappearance of two hundred and seventy-six people, in the state in nineteen ninety-six and nineteen ninety-seven, and his report presented, was presented to the Ministry of Justice, in August in nineteen ninety-seven. um it contained ev- evidence, of the involvement of both civil, and military police. um in response to this report the delegations from the Human Rights Commission of, the Federal Chamber of Deputies, visited the region in October, twenty-third nineteen ninety-seven. on that e- occasion Giselle Marques de Carval Fontoura, received anonymous telephone calls about the secret cemetery, and cars with unknown occupants began circling her house, and parked outside her front gate. so this is just an example of how, one person tried, to do some investigation, and, they're, these people are, intimidated, they received phone threats, until they're eve- either forced into go into hiding or th- even forced to leave their country. and here's an example of how a defender was um, subjected to death squads. one activist was shot dead, on his doorstep, and another had to flee to another part of the country, for fear of his life. Francsico- Francisco Gilson Nogueira de Carvalho, a lawyer, at the Center for Human Rights and Collective Memory in Natal, um the state capital, was shot dead by six men outside his house, on the twentieth of October in nineteen ninety-six. he was killed by thirteen bullets, and most of them to the head. he had been working with special commission, set up by the State Attorney, General in May nineteen ninety-five, to investigate the activities, of the Golden Boys, which is a death squad, believed to be responsible for numerous killings, as well as cases of, tortures and death threats, carried out mainly in poor areas, of Natal. since nineteen ninety-five, allegations had been repeatedly made, that the death squad operat- operated under the deputy, se- of secre- the deputy ze- secretary, of public security. Francisco Gilson Nogueira de Carvalho killers, his killers have never been found, and an official of- investigation was clos- closed due to lack of e- evidence. this just shows that there is a need for an improvement in the judi- judicial system and prosecution in Brazil. um, it is sad to see that these people who are defending, the defenseless are also subjected, to the same, harassment that as the people that they're defending. in fact people, sometimes even accused the defenders, of um, of defending criminals. not all people view, the death squads, as violating the human rights of others. many, policemen and members of the general public truly believe, that some social groups are devoid of rights. like, if they're discriminated against and if people people harass them they believe that well they're lower and, it doesn't matter because, they're not considered at the same level as they are. um there is also there're specific articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which defends these specific social groups. for example, Article Twenty-Five defends street children, by saying that um, what is it? um by saying that          <SEG TYPE="READING"> all children shall enjoy the same, social protection. </SEG>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NNS" ROLE="JF" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="POR"> mhm </U2>
          so. and then there's another qu- um Article Five defends common pris- prisoners and indigenous people by saying          <SEG TYPE="READING"> no one shall be subjected, to torture or to cr- cruel, inhumane or de- degrading treatment or punishment. </SEG>
          although Brazilian government seems to be committed to protecting, and supporting the human rights of its citizens, it pon- it s- it seems to be commi- committed to this by um, promises made by national legislation, and by national humans rights programs, which have been established and put into effect by the federal government. however, the human rights defenders, are the ones who have done most of the work to achieve the importance of human rights in Brazil. although there are still multiple, examples of blatant violations of these, articles in the, in the declaration. for example, here's an example of um, discrimination against street children. and also this is, also deals with, the harassment of defenders too. on October twelfth December nineteen ninety-three, street educators from the Catholic Church, Children's Pastor- Pastoral, Jonas Beltrao de Oliveira and Jonathan Luke Hannay, attempted to mediate a confrontation between police and street children. um, the police started beating, a sixteen-year-old girl and a twe- eleven-year-old boy. the police then allegedly hit Jonathan Hannay in the stomach, and a number of, local street traders, then started beating up on Jonas Beltrao, while people did nothing. he was left semi-conscious with a cranial fracture and perforated eardrum. after that n- incident, they both, continued to, suffer police harassment. so this just goes to show that, first of all the, street children were being harassed by the policemen, and then the policemen, um, were beating up the defenders who were trying to protect the children, and then, um, street traders jumped in and started beating up on the defenders. that just, shows that, like the general public needs to be educated, about, like human rights in the country so, they could team up and, um, defend human rights of each other. um, another example is um, on the thirteenth of November nineteen, ninety-two, the body of a thirteen-year-old, um, Jean Alves da Ca- Cunha hed- a leader of the National Streets Children Movement, was found dumped on a hillside in, Vitoria Espirito, Santos state, with gunshot wounds to the head and ear. he was last seen, on the evening of November eleventh being detained by members of justitif- justice officials, attached to juvenile courts. he was about to attend, the Third National Congress, of the National, Street Children's Movement, in Brasilia, and at the preparatory meeting he had denounced the local police, for putting pressure on street children to commit crimes, and share the pro- proceeds with them. he taped the allegations and expressed, fear for his safety. his death had, has been linked to a number of similar, death          <SIC> quads </SIC>
          killings, allegedly committed by a police organization, in the area. the S-D-L-C military police, has been accused of his murder, and was acquitted in military court in May nineteen ninety-seven. so here's another example of when they caught, the, people who were violating the human rights and, again they're acquitted and, they weren't prosecuted. furthermore another group of, um a social class i guess you could say or, a group of people which are, commonly discriminated against in Brazil are um, just common prisoners which have been sentenced, to prison for petty crimes. um, on Dec- the second, on October second nineteen twenty-two, a rebellion erupted in one of          <SIC> San </SIC>
          Paulo's largest prisidents, prisons.          <FOREIGN> la Casa de Detencao. </FOREIGN>
