          and the one, the one that has to be based on a, on a specific uh, internship, is called curricular practical training, and the one that's just carte blanche, is called optional practical training. but we, w- we, we're constantly involved, in, uh in (xx) so we have, we have workshops throughout the, throughout the semester and, we have handouts and we use to, uh, mostly the students are, generally aware that...        </U1>

          uh... the f- the first, kind, of internship that's based on a specific, uh uh job related to the to the field, the one that's called curricular practical training, can only be given, prior to graduation, okay? and can be given on a part-time basis or a full-time basis. if it's given on a f- if it's given on a part-time basis during the academic year, then the student must continue to be registered as a full-time student. okay? if it's given, on a full-time basis, during the academic year, then the student doesn't have to be registered at all, while they are doing the job, full-time. if it's given, for during the vacation term, then the student doesn't need to be registered, uh anyway, but they can be if they, uh if they if they wish. the other program called the optional practical training, oh i_ and i should say that the first one, the curricular practical training, is unlimited, there's no time limit, on how, many months a person could actually do this. theoretically over a, five year period, or a six year period a person might, s- spend two or three years, at different times, doing, curricular practical training. however, the other practical training program the optional practical training program, is restricted to a total of twelve months, you can borrow part of this before you graduate, or you can save up and wait and use it all, after you graduate. however, if a student, participates in, twelve months, or more, of the curricular practical training, if they participate on a full-time basis, then after they graduate they, they forfeit, using the optional practical training. however, if they sign up for curricular practical training on a part-time basis, before they graduate, then they don't lose anything, no matter how long they worked, on a part-time basis. now, a person who wants to get optional practical training, has a choice of borrowing before they graduate. and you can borrow on either part-time basis, or a full-time basis. if you borrow on a part-time basis, before you graduate, then you lose one month, of your, postcompletion practical training, for every two months that you work prior to completion on a part-time basis. if you borrow on a full-time basis, before you graduate then for every month that you work before you graduate, one month would be deducted from the twelve month total after you graduate. so, you know tha- i've i_ probably spent too much time on that you don't usually, uh        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so we've </OVERLAP1>
          uh, we've been funding a lot of uh students from the School of Natural Resources, which is          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> oh that's interesting </U2>
          yeah yeah yeah and they're they're working on these fascinating projects and most of them are (in) Eastern Europe and they're working (on, pollution) and what to do with it and so some of their, their internships sound, sound really fascinating we've also funded a number of people from the Law School, a number of undergraduates a lot of them from the uh, German Department, there's a woman there who's been really active, in finding internships for their students there          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          so depends you know if there's a good contact, in any given department, trying to find internships we find that we get a lot, of of (wind-) uh applicants, and also we funded a number of students who've applied both to the International Institute and also applied to our center, for funding. the other thing we're offering right now is uh funding to obtain summer language programs          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and uh, so          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> oh mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          yeah and a lot of them is for our_ for the joint M-B-A and area studies uh students. but we'll consider anybody for instance in the M-B-A program who would be, taking a language at the expense of a very uh you know i mean (the) opportunity (cost is) an internship (paying) a lot of money so, uh we consider students who, you know prefer a language over their internships so we will consider funding it to study a language. uh currently we have, uh a study tour going on to uh, Japan, uh Singapore, and there are eighteen people on that trip a combination of PhD students, faculty and uh M-B-As. and, that's about it.        </U1>

          makes me very sad and then_ and she's getting out just at the right time          <EVENT WHO="S10" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          because we are starting onto summer orientation um, and that's, at the the beginning of the summer we have, less to do with international students because they do tend to come in (for,) either the summer term or the, the fall and so, our big, big thing is gonna be, the uh week of, the end of of August. but we do get a handful in periodically and, and sometimes we even, have interesting, situations where they're here for E-L-I courses and they're also          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          supposed to be taking, L-S-and-A courses or something (else,) and so, we, talked with E-L-I about that but i_ really there's not a whole lot we we've been waiting to hear, um about the financial situation for, for uh some of these students from the five countries that've been hit financially, and, as, Amy has said it's, it's there somewhere this decision but i- or i- or the decision may not even be there, th- the issue is stuck somewhere so i'd thought that there was a, an a May eleventh deadline, do y- do you know          <OVERLAP1> about that? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> for those um </U1>

          that legal counsel was still not um,          <OVERLAP1> (willing) to- </OVERLAP1>

          imagine that because it's it's quite an interesting issue when you look at what, um i don't know how many of you, have have seen the details of this but NAFSA, put out um the the guidelines for this, this matching um, funding and, they were very clear about it was, the- what was the business council? which business council? I        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> I uh um was it          <OVERLAP1> I-E-E </OVERLAP1>

          working on this. and and they, very clearly said, these students, are eligible for this so, we have a real problem people studying, poli sci or or econ are eliminated from it it's computer science engineering business and, and hard sciences well you know, that just doesn't,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> yeah </U2>
          cut it for L-S-and-A anyway and i think um_ and then of course there's the issue of how many graduate students there are s- an- and and uh and undergraduates and, the whole pot needs to be looked at and it was very hard to coordinate (and) get all this information gathered, um so that they can figure out how,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          they're gonna allocate funds        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and and the other thing is that um, these um, it's it's not a huge amount of um, uh of money although of course every every bit helps um          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and it's a limited number of          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> could get </OVERLAP1>
          so, um but as i- wh- what i um_ i mean there's the uh, the the field of study thing but i guess the main the main thing is just that it's um it's only for students from those countries and if, if          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          they used university funds to match it as opposed to some of the,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> (this thing) </OVERLAP1>
          s- yeah oh, i know you guys do. one thing that we did do, uh with_ for some of our students was um, we were able to, let them go ahead and, preregister for for fall even spring-summer even if they had a financial hold,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> oh </U2>

          yes for for the record.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          this was just in my head, you know, so. but no i mean i i'm assuming that then they're kind of looking twice at anything that          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure </U2>

          along with it, so. no we look at every application we receive...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> one other thing that i, just wanted to (quickly) mention um, is that, we are trying, we will, continue to try to get particularly the Korean, group together, um in the fall, the, undergraduate students who have_ seem to have,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          a lot of trouble, um getting through their their first couple of years of, undergraduate college, and so uh, i will i'll keep you posted but i would also um, ask for some help probably in the fall that the, the undergraduate, association, of Korean students wants to do a series of, programs early in the fall i haven't even had a chance to talk to you about this cuz it, it just came to (xx) um, so peo- it'll be very helpful um, to, to get some of you involved in some of these presentations to help them, understand what the resources are around campus. and, i just thought i'd mention that cuz we've talked about the Korean student issue          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> mhm </U2>
          many times before, and we haven't been able to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i think that's nice that the student association is um, is getting involved and doing that and whatever we can do to          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          support them          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          i think would be good        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> and the and the reason this is happening and i j- it just, so happened that i saw the the newly elected vice president who happens to be the uh, roommate of the fellow who, who committed suicide,          <U2 WHO="SU-2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          um, in December and and          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          so he and he's, he will finally i think do something to pull this group together whereas i- in the past, we've not gotten any response from that group's leaders. so i think that there's much more potential this time around. with especially with what happened          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          in the fall with the suicide i think and and as well the uh the numbers of s- Korean students who were, um asked not to register again were stopped,          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> oh </U2>
          after fall term because of of very poor academic performance, there's there's motivation to, actually do some of these programs in the fall so, i'm looking forward to, to doing that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah and i know that um, that Counseling and Psychological Services is, um interested in reaching out more to the international student community um, you know making students more aware of what those services are and that might be something that          <OVERLAP1> could be fitted in you know i don't know </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. it that </OVERLAP1>
          that's a good thing i wanted to ask this before is there anybody from that group who gets these F-I-E,          <OVERLAP1> announcements </OVERLAP1>

          there is not at this point_ what_ um the reason that kind of came right to my mind is um, i just_ they're they're interviewing now for a couple of new staff members and um, they've asked um, ah people from the International Center and then also from, SAPAC and Services for Students with Disabilities to ah, to spend about an hour talking with each of the candidates          <U2 WHO="SU-4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> great </OVERLAP2>

          after a, a rather uh, hectic uh, last couple of months things are finally quieting down with the, International International Programs Office, uh, the one thing about working with students is that they, mostly clear out          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          by that last day of exams. and uh we can now catch up on a on a lot of things        </U1>

          and another four, sitting very high on their respective waitlists so we potentially have eleven out of fourteen, recipients uh and this is uh, a a really remarkable uh performance um, so we're real pleased with that.        </U1>

          but i think decreasingly so, because uh, over time the the the kinds of problems that, people feared might happen, had not happened, um, it's money that originates with the Department of Defense          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> mm </U2>
          and um, the money supports students who want to study in, countries uh, where, the U-S government feels we are lacking expertise, and f- and familiarity um and and it also uh s- particularly targets the study of, languages, languages which are not commonly studied, in American universities or not commonly taught, uh, so students who want to go to Russia          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> or China, </OVERLAP1>
          uh, or um to various countries in in South America or Africa uh, are eligible and tend to win awards. the uh, one of the problems with the um, the whole uh uh scholarship program is that uh, it might compromise the student, when the student's in the field if uh, somebody finds out the student has, Department of Defense support uh the student might be, perceived as an agent of the government it it's_          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> oh            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          the argument in itself is very problematic, and there are some universities which have refused to participate in the scholarship program Michigan takes a very neutral stance cuz it's, public money has to be made available um, uh, uh, there has not been a single incident, that i'm aware of, in which a student, uh          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> mhm </U2>

          because of N-S-E-P, uh support, in this past year however there has been a slight change in uh the scholarship arrangements, and, this almost actually was the uh s- uh, killed the scholarship program because uh, Congress imposed it and uh it was, uh, very uh, distasteful to a lot of people who have thrown their weight behind N-S-E-P, there is a, service obligation, uh          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> that's what i was going to ask </OVERLAP2>

          for um, for health service there's there's no deductible for the other two places, there's just a, a ten-dollar deductible and that's          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> so o- o- okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> per cause, </OVERLAP1>
          so it it covers, it covers that now if, if they're referred to someplace else and they've gone to one of the gatekeepers first then again, no deductible if they're referred from health service, um, ten dollars          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> so is this M-Care? </OVERLAP2>

          you'll lose um, the two things that might be different um, is          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> uhuh </U2>
          is you'll lose any kind of um, any kind of preventive care, i mean except for the, the well child care, well actually that won't even start until          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> no, right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> September if we do </OVERLAP1>
          it. you'll lose any kind of preventive care and um, this insurance does have a limitation on preexisting conditions. so if somebody um there's a waiting period for that so if somebody, comes um and again this is something that we're going to um, probably be able to change a little bit, starting in September but for this year, if somebody comes um, with some kind of condition that um, that they've had before some time          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> within the past </OVERLAP1>
          twelve months, um there's going to be a twelve-month waiting period before that condition is covered so there are some there are some caps i mean for the most um, um, for the most complete coverage if i mean for the students we          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> kind of </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NRN" ROLE="ST" SEX="F" AGE="4" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="TAG"> okay, so hospitalization stuff like (xx) </U1>
