   <TEXT>     <BODY>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay thanks, um so this should be kinda cool, um, and to confound things i am really high on cough syrup, so um,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> neato </U2>
          you guys are all sort of floating. it's really cool. um, so the last few weeks we've been talking about, um experimental design and, statistics, and we're just about wrapping up the teaching part of the semester and we're gonna move into the final project part, so what i wanted to do today was to sort of just go over some of the concepts that we've talked about, and uh focus on issues that're gonna be important for actually designing your study. um, probably the most important concept and some stuff we've talked about i just wanna, focus on it again, talk about it in a little more depth, are issues about validity and confounds. and, as you'll remember the, the whole point of running an experiment as compared to a nonexperiment, is that we can make, causal inferences. we can infer that um change in our independent variable results in change in the dependent variable. that our independent variable causes, the change. manipulate independent variable, you observe your dependent variable. um, and as we've talked about, if you don't do it right, a study that you design could, lead you to make a conclusion, that isn't actually valid. and we're gonna just talk about some more, some subtle some not so subtle, confounds and problems, and just to make sure you guys feel, comfortable with these things because, starting next class you're gonna have to start thinking about what your project is gonna be. so, you should at least start thinking about ideas, topics that you're interested in, and next class we're gonna start talking about how you'd actually run a study to, get at those questions. so, what i wanted to start with, just an example of a pretty famous psychological task, that was actually invented at Michigan. actually no it wasn't invented at Michigan it was invented by, i guess it was. it was a dissertation of a professor who's now at Michigan, who was a graduate student at Michigan, who published it when he was working at at uh Bell Labs. but anyway, it's called a lexical decision task. and, you guys may have seen this in some of the studies you were run in Psych one-eleven. basically the job is you get two words, and um your job is to decide if they're both words or if one of 'em is- isn't a word. so you get strings of letters, they may be words. in this case, the word bread, the word butter are both, words. and, what you're_ what they're actually interested in, is only in the times where the words are actually real words. and what they do is sometimes you'll get a word like bread first, and then the next thing you'll get is a word like butter, which is semantically rel- semantically related. so the idea is that if the way memory is structured is such that, like concepts are close together, then seeing bread will prime, the term butter and the word butter'll be responded to faster, than a nonrelated word. so if you compare, response time of, uh indicating that butter is a word to in the same situation indicating that the word nurse, is a word, if butter is faster than nurse then it indicates that there's semantic relations between words and that you're actually doing something called semantic priming. so that the way your memory is structured, activating the word bread activates all related concepts including butter, whereas nurse isn't a related concept. um, um, the bottom part is boring. um, and the whole point of lexical decision task is to demonstrate that congruent pairs are processed, faster than incongruent pairs. and this is an experimental task that's been design- it was designed in the late sixties and it's been run, a million times since then. but, just because the task is a good task doesn't mean that an experiment using that task is gonna be, a valid experiment.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          and, when we're talking about the validity of an experiment, we're talking about how... th- the extent to which one's findings can be shown to be, valid in the real world or correspond to the way the real world is. and there's all s- all different types of validity and we talked about, a few of 'em uh f- about a month ago. but, i just wanna go over them and talk about them in this context, and talk about some other, studies and some problems and, your job later is gonna be to figure out what's wrong with some studies. so, if the independent variable really causes a change in the dependent variable, then we say that a study is internally valid. so, if my manipulation of the word relatedness is actually what's causing, this difference in speed between nurse and butter, then i could say that it's an internally valid study my independent variable is, causing a change in my dependent variable. however, if it's not internally valid there could be something else that's leading to the problem. so a true internally valid study, you would control everything else. you would control the frequency of the words. so for example if butter, turns out to be twice as frequent in the English language as the word nurse, then the reason you respond quickly to butter might be because (of) the frequency of the word as opposed to relatedness, of the concepts. um, if the length of the word makes a difference. if it turns out that, because butter is is a two-syllable word and nurse is a one-syllable word, if you_ it turns out that you respond quicker to two-syllable words, then, maybe you're not actually showing this bu- bread butter effect, but in fact you're showing, a two syllable one syllable word effect. so, if these things are held constant you've got an internally valid study. if they're not, if there's something else going on, then it's not internally valid. another example is if you have a hundred people taking part in the study and, the first fifty people see pairs of related words, and then the second set of fifty subjects see, sets of unrelated words, and you compare performance and you still find a difference, you still c- you you can't be sure you've got internal validity because there's other things going on. okay, and, how would we get around this problem, of having the first fifty people in one condition, and the first fifty in another condition?          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          okay you're running a study, and you've got a hundred subjects. the first fifty come in and you just point them to the, condition A room. and after they get in there then the next fifty you point them to the condition B room, and, you see a difference in their performance. is it condition A and condition B that's causing the difference, can you be sure of that?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you have to do randomization </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you have to do some type of randomization. right. so what might be making a difference is that, the two conditions are different for more than just, relatedness and unrelatedness. it t- might turn out that the first fifty people are more highly motivated. or that the, first fifty people are better readers. and that, you know there was a sign up there and they so they read it first so they signed up first or something. if you don't, if you don't remove the systematicity, between the conditions that isn't, part of your independent variable, you can't be sure that it's your independent variable that's making a difference. so the goal is that, you wanna try to remove the possibility of confounds, of other, variables affecting your independent variable in different ways. you guys should remember stuff about confounds. even though you've been quizzed on it you still have to know this stuff. so, that's internal validity. the next type of validity, is construct validity.          <PAUSE DUR=":09" ></PAUSE>          and, basically, construct validity involves a couple of things. first of all, it involves the operationalization of, your concepts. so, if you're interested in intelligence, you have to operationalize what what your variables are. you have to come up with something that, you think reflects intelligence. if you're interested in, um... any other independent variable, um height for example, you have to have an operational variable. so you would use, um inches as opposed to people's perception of somebody's height. you want something that, can be measured and compared. in addition to operationalizing it, you also have to be able to come up with a way to test it so that, you can be sure that, you're able to dif- differentiate your theory from other theories. and this is kind of related to falsifiability. if you run a study, and, your results can be interpreted as supporting your theory, or supporting an alternative theory, then your study isn't very, construct valid. because, you're finding a result and you're saying look, it supports my theory. but, the guy that you're trying to to show, whose theory's wrong, he says the same thing, your theory didn't do anything. it just wasted money, and wasted time and, gave some, Psych one-eleven students some credit. so, what you wanna be able to do is have, operationally defined, theories, and you wanna be able to discriminate your theory from alternative theories. um, in a particularly bizarre study, McGinnis, um, had people do something similar to a lexical decision task, where people saw, either vulgar words or nonvulgar words. and this was run, i think like in the early seventies. and, basically they would see a word on the screen, and they would have to say the word. and sometimes the word would be a vulgar word, sometimes there would be a nonvulgar word. and, McGinnis measured, how long it took before the person said the word. and, his theory was that it takes longer to perceive vulgar words than nonvulgar words. that, something in the perceptual apparatus of human cognition makes it more difficult to perceive vulgar words than nonvulgar words, for some reason. well there're some problems with this study, even though it got published and everything else. one is that, the word perceive, they're saying that it's_ that it has to do with perceiving vulgar words, and by measuring the time it takes you to say something, what you're actually getting at is the time it takes you to perceive the word. well, as you guys should know from, like the second week of Psych three-forty, the subtractive method, you can't be sure, what else is going on. there's perception, there's also production. mkay? you're measuring how long it takes somebody to say the words, so it may turn out that, the problem isn't necessarily perceiving the word, that slows you down. it may be that, you read the word just as quickly whether it's vulgar or nonvulgar but, you pause when you're about to say a vulgar word because maybe, you sort of don't feel comfortable saying vulgar words. so, rather than measuring, perception what he's actually measuring is something that includes perception and production and maybe something else going on. the idea is that, he thought he had a theory, that he was trying to support, but in fact he was supporting a whole bunch of different theories and he w- wasn't really ruling out many theories.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so the goal, the whole point, is to be able to rule out other possible theories.          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          so you can kind of think of, of the scientific method as sort of a competition. like other people want their theories to be right and you want your theories to be right, and you wanna run studies that you could show that your theories are right and that theirs aren't. so the whole point of construct validity is, to get rid of other explanations and show that you're right. there's another problem with McGinnis' study. and that is that it lacks external validity, or that it might lack external validity. and external validity is, the extent to which, what you're finding can hold true in other, situations. other times, other people, other locations, and, if we were, to try to make some type of public policy or something else based on a study like McGinnis', we may run into some trouble. because that was, done in the seventies, and now it's the, two thousands, the, the the zeroes, the naughties, something, um, it might be that that vulgar words in society are different. i mean just the fact that the Fox, network exists has increased the number of vulgar words that people talk about in the shows like N-Y-P-D Blue and the whole uh, Monica Lewinsky affair. all sorts of vulgar concepts are talked about much more frequently now than they wer- may have been in the seventies. so, if you were to try to say that the results, assuming that all the other problems were fine, if you were trying to talk about the results of the McGinnis study and talk about how it applies today, you might run into some trouble because the world has changed. so the goal of external validity is to rule out the possibility that your findings, are only specific to a person or an environment, or something very small. you want_ external validity means you can apply your results and your findings to, a number of different areas.          <PAUSE DUR=":09" ></PAUSE>          so, you run a study and you find out, that um, the mean the score in one condition is different than the mean score in another condition. so, i'll move back up to the top in just a moment. but, you find out that you're doing a study of, uh dyads in conversation, you count the number of times men touch women and the number of times women touch men. and you find out that twenty-five times, men touch women and only twenty-two times women touch men and you say look there's a difference. see twenty-five is different than twenty-two, so there's two different numbers so i found a difference. but you're not actually gonna say that because why...? okay i'll give you a hint it says          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it's not. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it right </OVERLAP1>
          here,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          the f- the fact is that we rely on statistical tests, to determine whether, just by chance we would've found this difference. and, it'd be very hard to show these two being statistically significant because we're only talking about a small sample, and three isn't really big enough. um, so, this is an example of statistical validity. and, this is, regardless of whether you have all these other, validity problems, regardless of whether you have internal validity, or uh, external validity or construct validity. the fact is you're gonna get some numbers, and you have to decide if the numbers are the same or different. if, the two conditions or three conditions of your independent variable, are resulting in, similar results or different results, are they the same groups or different groups. so first of all you have to choose the appropriate test. and, hopefully you guys have at least a general idea that you're not supposed to look for, correlations when you're looking at differences and you're not supposed to use ANOVAs when you're looking at r- at how similar things are. there're certain rules about using just the right test. um, then there's also issues that we're not gonna get into too much but, there are issues about the the assumptions that you're making about your test. um, one example is that reaction time data is not normally distributed. reaction time data, if you take how long it takes people to respond to some stimulus, are nearly always positively skewed. there's a bunch of examples that happen really early on, and then there's a really long tail off to one way. and if you're doing the study and you're using reaction time data, you can't run ANOVAs on pure reaction time data because they violate an assumption of the ANOVA which is that distributions are normal. so if you guys decide to do reaction time data we hafta, change 'em um, there's a few different ways you can change 'em, um basically you're normalizing them and you end up talking about things like Z-scores, which allow you to uh, to compare reaction time data to other data.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so, and then finally, your          <SIC> esults </SIC>
         <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          shouldn't be due to chance alone. and that was the whole point about the twenty-two versus twenty-five, instances of men and women touching each other. you wanna rely on something, that will allow you to talk about what the likelihood that your results were discovered by chance versus, whether you would find it again if you ran the study again.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          mkay um so there's a few more types of validity that, we'll just sort of, well there's one more that we'll buzz through really quickly. which is ecological validity. which is basically, very closely related to external validity, and we probably won't ask you to compare the two of 'em together. but, ecological validity is basically, how likely are these findings to occur in the real world if you ran, the laboratory study? so, is this phenomenon just something that exists in the lab or is it something that, exists in the real world? so, in a lab you try to control for all sorts of things, um and if you're interested in in how working memory works and how many words people can recall and you decide to give 'em a study where they have these nonsense words that they have to recall, so you give 'em a list of of things like waf, buv, all sorts of words that don't have any real meaning. and then you see after thirty seconds how many of ten words can they recall, and you find out it's six, can you say that this, six out of ten is gonna hold for sentences and real words?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          if you talk to people in marketing, a lot of times they'll, abuse psychological results. they'll say that such and such study shows that people can recall sixty percent of presented information so therefore if you're, if you have a commercial you should present the important information three times because it'll be more likely to be recalled and all sorts of things like that, when in fact they're trying to extract, a real world use for something that might not necessarily be true. it might turn out that people are much better at, recalling words if they're in a context or if they're real words. which makes sense, because you already have a sort of a mental structure for real words and not for, for false words. um, and you could think of, an example if i give you a list of, um, of nine letters, and i ask you to recall them, and i just chose nine letters randomly, you would you would get a few right. but if those same nine letters, if i gave you, F-B-I, C-I-A, N-B-C, everybody would recall all nine of them. because you have meaning related to the second set and you didn't really have any meaning related to, the random letters. so if you tried to use random letters and extract meaning and how they'd be existing in the real world, you'd you'd run into some troubles. so, the goal of ecological validity is to make sure that, what you're measuring is something that is related to the real world and not just a laboratory phenomenon. now may turn out that all you're really interested in is something in the lab, and that's fine but, you shouldn't then think that you can talk about the real world that way.          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          so are there questions so far, about this stuff? the many flavors of validity?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          mkay so let's talk about some studies and, sort of tear 'em apart if we can... you'll remember that the enemy of, validity is the confound. and we hate confounds. and a confound is when a change in the dependent variable can be caused by, something that isn't the independent variable. because you haven't separated the independent variable and whatever this other variable is... so, Anne Treisman, another famous psychologist, um, developed a task called the visual search task. and your job was to, to see a whole bunch of, letters. there're Ts and Os, a whole bunch of 'em on a screen, and your job is to find the green T and there's a bunch of green Os and black Ts, which are called distracters. but there's one target, your green T... and so she ran a study, where her independent variable was the number of distracters. so she either had four, distracters ten distracters or sixteen distracters, and half of the distracters were, green Os and half of the distracters were black Ts. and then the- there was one green T in the middle. and, her dependent variable was that she measured, how long it took people to detect whether the green T was there or not. so in some cases there was no green T and they had to r- say no, other case there was a green T and they had to say yes. and you look at how long it takes 'em to say yes. and what she found, was that as the total number of distracters increases, the reaction time increases. so, when there are, ten distracters it takes longer to find, the T than if there're only four distracters. and if there's sixteen it takes longer than ten and four so... so you would conclude, that the number of distracters affects, the ability to find the target. well it turns out, that, there're some issues of internal validity. for example, and this is, this bottom thing is kind of what the task looks like but, it's done really poorly but... the problem is there's some internal validity issues. so, when there's four distracters there's two black Ts and two green Os, and when there's ten there's five and five, and when there's sixteen there's eight and eight. now there could be three things that're causing this increase, or th- or decrease in reaction time. it could be that, your independent variable's having this effect. that the sheer number of distracters will affect, the speed with which you can identify the target. that's example number one. your independent variable's making a difference. but there's two other alternative hypotheses. one is that it's just the number of green Os that increases, reaction time. so that, the number of things that're the same color as the target are really what's making a difference, or it could be the number of black Ts that're making the difference, so the number of things that're the same shape, makes a difference. but because, the number of green Os and black Ts and the number of distracters all varied in the same way, you have no way of separating them. did you follow me on that part? mkay this is an important concept, the idea that, just because your inde- your independent variable moves, from four to ten to sixteen. if something else increases at the same rate, then you can't be sure if it's your independent variable that's making a difference or one of those other things that's increasing at the same rate. so what she should have done, is run the study at four and she should've had, um one to three distracters of each type, and then she should've done it at ten and she should've had, one to nine or one t- yeah one to nine distracters of each type, and she should've run it at sixteen with one to fifteen distracters of each type. and then she could've found out that, it could be the number of distracters, or it could be the number of distracters of the same color or the number of distracters of the same shape. and she would've been able to get at that problem. but, because she didn't do that, she's unable to get around the confound, which is that the number of distracters total, is highly related with number of the distracters of each type.          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          so, that is sort of, a summary of some of the stuff that we talked about last time in a way to sort of bring, some of the ideas we've talked about more recently, together. um, starting next week you guys are gonna have um, basically i'm gonna stop talking to you about new stuff, and you guys are gonna start talking to me about ideas that you've had for your final projects. um, you can work in, groups of up to two, and you're gonna, design the study, run it on each other. write it up, and then you guys are each gonna, each group'll make fun of the other groups to, you know sort of do what what we call peer review, and um then i get to grade you, um so what i'd like to do now, before we go on to talking about, um the lab and doing some more look at_ work looking at confounds i wanna just do a quiz review, because on Wednesday, you guys have your fourth and final quiz. so, if you could take out your lists of terms to know and, lemme know if you have any questions about things from, list number four.          <PAUSE DUR=":16" ></PAUSE>          yep?

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay, so there are three things that that we look for in a two-by-two, design. one thing you wanna look for is, and we'll call this, I-V one, and this'll be, I-V two. so we look for three things. first of all we wanna know, regardless of, of who's taking the S-A-Ts, we wanna know whether people do better on math or verbal. right? we're, just running a study, we wanna make sure the people who are designing the math section are designing it at, at a similar difficulty to the verbal section, or if we want 'em to be different, do you have a hypothesis that they're different? so, first we say, is does I-V one have a main effect, regardless of anything else going on? and in this case it would, because you'd say that the math, the mean of the math scores is higher than the mean of the verbal scores. so the marginal means are different. then you wanna know, regardless of what part they're taking, overall on the S-A-Ts, do psych people do better than engineering people? and in this case you'd say, there's a main effect for independent variable two, right? because psych people do better than engineering people. but, we could've run two separate studies and found those things and you know it would have been woo hoo big deal. the big question is, is there s- is there something else going on? and what you're saying is, if there's two parallel lines, well they're both being affected, so isn't there shouldn't there be some type of interaction? and, what we do is we look to see, if we just ran the study only on engineering people, we'd see a study we'd say okay look see, verbal you do worse than on math. and if we ran it just on, psych people, we get rid of the verbal peop- the engineering people, we'd say the same thing, right? but we'd say oh you know psych people do better than verbal people, than engineering people. but... if we look at whether the lines are parallel, whether, the decrease as you go to verbal, is the same or different for the two groups, you you learn something about whether the two groups are different in more than just the sort of, overall way. and, if they're parallel, what you're saying is that this independent variable is affecting psych people and engineering people in exactly the same way. we don't we don't see anything that that is any more interesting than the fact that psych people and engineering people are different and math and verbal are different. mkay but if they're not parallel          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          then we suddenly have something that's that's interesting. we say first of all, it's probably not a good idea to, talk about psych people and engineering people being affected by independent variable one in the same way. because they're ati- they seem to be affected in different ways. and from this type of graph it appears that psych people do worse on verbal, and engineering people don't do any worse on verbal. or you could also, say psych people improve on math and engineering people don't improve on math. they mean the same thing. but because they're not parallel, suddenly you're seeing that, this independent variable affects this independent variable differently. and that's the key. so when they're not parallel, suddenly you see something that's more interesting than just knowing the two main effects. does that help?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah oh and interpreting is sort of the ability to interpret statistics or graphs. you should understand, how to interpret things. so, if i give you a graph, that looks like this, you have to be able to tell me if there's, a main effect for um, for field of study a main effect for, test type and if there's an interaction between the two. also if i give you, um the results of an S-P-S-S ANOVA output, you have to tell me whether there're main effects or interactions and_ or what the P values are.          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          other questions?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is a minor question. um, when you look at the ANOVA, um i think when we did it, the lab in class you said there was that the residual was another word for between-subjects          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but in the book it said it was, the, for within. so that's why i was confused. so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so when you see a residual, you should think of it_ it it's a little it's basically saying the stuff you can't explain. if you're doing between-subjects ANOVA that means it's the within-subject stuff. if you're doing a within-subjects ANOVA it's the between stuff.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

          measures, so that_ basically the key is that you_ what you do is you look for, the stuff the, the stuff that's being described as the main effect. and you compare it to the stuff being described as residual. and, when you do your F-test, you use, the, main effect thing as the first number and, the degrees of freedom and, the residual as the second number of degrees of freedom.          <U2 WHO="S7" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure. so, instead of math and verbal, we'll now pretend instead of the S-A-Ts it's the G-R-Es. so, we'll add,          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          analytical... so, we're just talking about, ho- what this graph would look like if we had three levels of one of the independent variables, um and whether you could tell if there's main effects or interactions. so math analytic and verbal. and you're still on that same scale from t- it's two hundred is that the lowest you can get on a section, on the S-A-Ts? yeah i think it's the same on the G-R-Es. so two hundred to eight hundred. and, and you'll note i also did this thing with the two slashes because there's no zero on this scale um, so, we would just have three points on here, and we talked about this last time, if you have a two-by-three design, where one independent variable has two levels another one has three levels, you're better off putting the three-level one on the X-axis, and the two-level one as lines. it just tends to be easier to compare two lines to each other than to compare three lines to each other. so what you would do is you draw, let let's say that, um a psych person isn't great on math, um does very well on analytic and about the same on verbal. and let's say the engineering person does perfectly on math, um, very well on analytical and bombs out on verbal          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so, the first thing we look for, is, is there a main effect for, test type? math versus analytic versus verbal. and how would you check to see if that's, a significant main effect?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> just check the, marginal means for each of the gr- groups </U1>

          like one of the things i mentioned as a limitation to the project was that, you know the words, the words varied,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          between the different, groups but you know you co- couldn't do anything about that. i didn't say that was confounding because, it was,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          you know it was different for all groups.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. beca- everybody saw all the same words in some_ in one of the conditions, because, there were there were four lists of words.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and there were four different conditions so it's somewhere along (the way,) so i- by our randomization it got rid of that as a confounding problem.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          if it turned out that we kept the same lists for recall, and different lists for recognition, then there could be a confound because, the list type, varied at_ the same way that recall versus recognition varied. does that make sense? so it was          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          there was a systematic difference that wasn't recognition versus recall but it was rather words.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>

       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> we uh, talked about the essay material, the material was something that was more stereotypically male like sports, it might be more apt to, (agree with the) male versus the female </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so, if if the material was such that people thought male as opposed to female, that would be, um a weakness of the study but it wouldn't necessarily be a confound. because it wouldn't be affecting one group and not the other group.          <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          all conditions would see the same thing and, all conditions would presumably think male (xx) even though they were different names. so that could be a weakness of the study. and if you were running (that study) you'd have to make sure that you chose something that wasn't, thought to be male or female or anything. yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe males are more critical, than females, and, they uh,          <OVERLAP1> females have higher scores for the essay because </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so why would they have rated it better? </OVERLAP2>

          they rate higher.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, so, the the fact that both males and females scored males higher than females... you're saying if if if by difference between males and females are you talking about the difference between the, essay writers or the judges? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the judges </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so they're they're, if if we found the difference between male and female scores, like the the male judge scores and the female judge scores, we, we would say that that could be a problem or that could be an effect that we're interested in finding. in this particular case we're gonna assume that the scores were both the same. males scored males higher and females scored males higher... other possible ideas for what the confound is? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> could it also be, it depends on like the students that are evaluating it, like what what their back- what their background is, like if you have, males, and females that are all the same discipline and all, like from the same area that's (xx) that they'll both be different, if you take male engineers and female          <OVERLAP1> psych students then, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          it would depend on        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so one thing you wanna make sure of is that you have, um a random assignment to to conditions you wanna randomly select males and females from the same population, and if you didn't do that, that could be a confound. good. other, other confounds with (the actual) materials?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          mkay well, it turns out that, um, (Venin Kasov) looked at this study and he thought that maybe there's a problem with it. and what he did, was he went through and looked at, the fact that, like how people rate different names. he said forget about gender. i'm interested are some names more positively connotated than others? and he found that in fact there is a difference the for example the name Waldo is rated less favorably than William. even though they're both male names. some names have, more positive connotations than others. and it turns out that this happens for all different names, for various reasons, for example names that were very popular in the twenties and thirties might be associated with certain n- concepts, and names that are s- that were really popular in the eighties and nineties are associated with different concepts. so, what he found was that he looked back at the names that were used in his actual study, and he found that the names that Goldberg had chosen, unwittingly were less attractive female names and more attractive male names. so if you take the n- a male name and you feminize it, just sort of the w- the way he did it, it turns out that, you have to make sure that you're you're keeping it at the same attractiveness level and, he didn't do that. um, so what he did is he actually then took a whole huge corpus of names, and he compared male to female, ratings of males' and female names, and it turns out that the average is the same. so it it was just a problem with the selection of names. so that if somebody were to try to rerun this study,          <U2 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          one thing they would wanna do is have the names pretested first, to make sure that they're equivalent as far as, uh positive and negative connotations before you start making assumptions about gender. okay? this is, the most, i think this is probably the most difficult one on the list so,          <OVERLAP1> does that </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah that's why we skipped it. </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          make sense? that, that that would be a problem if, the names were different positively and negatively regardless of gender...? mkay so then the teaching one, statistics class. yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> kids who take an engineering class are just better at like, statistics or had some more previous knowledge, so they scored higher. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so that engineering students are just different than psych students and they're better at statistics.          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          right, yeah. if, if you, if you don't randomly assign people's conditions, then any differences that are, existing may be what results from your change in your dependent variable. um, so if you wanted to really be sure that this was the effect you would, um randomly, you'd have the two versions of the engineering class and one would get one type and one would get another type the two versions of the, psych class and one would get one type of teaching and the other would get the other type of teaching. and then you can get rid of the engineering versus psychology effect. good. okay the punishment one...          <OVERLAP1> (Ashley?) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so, </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the um, the people who dropped out were the ones who had the low scores, because they would get shocked a lot          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          (xx) people, and the people who were getting shocked dropped out, so the people who (xx) would (probably have an, effect.)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so su- so subjects in the shocking condition dropped out more like, more frequently than subjects in the non-shocking condition. and what'd we call that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> subject attrition </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> subject attrition right. so, if you don't know what the difference between the people who dropped out and the people who stayed in is, you can't make the assumption that that, they're the groups are actually different it might be all the wimps in one group dropped out and the wimps in the other group stayed. (xx) yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> could you also say that there's not, that the punishment versus reward isn't equal? like you can't compare getting shocked to getting a dime. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, it might be that punishment and reward aren't equal. the shock might not be exactly ten cents worth of shock.          <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, it might be that the equivalent, you know to, counter the equivalent pain of the shock it might actually be better to give people a dollar fifty for every one they got right, or twenty dollars or a hundred dollars. something to try to even that out. right so, you might have this this disc- difference, in the level, the intensity of the two conditions. right? is that what you were (gonna say?) mkay. um, the creativity study, uh males versus females and writing down stuff about army compass and the monkey wrench... yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S9" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> men might be more familiar with things to do with an army compass and a monkey wrench than women. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, so it might be that the the objects are more masculine than, feminine. yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and, he's just testing creativity, but then he brings in pressure (and that,) which is another independent variable. so there may be some sort of interaction. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right now that's not necessarily a confound that's actually a good thing right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> why, if he's only testing for creativity? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, he's testing for creativity and he's testing for, creativity under pressure. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it doesn't say that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, by including another independent variable that's essentially what he's doing, but, if he just uses the marginal means, of the high and low pressure in those situations, you should be able to tell the difference between males and females regardless of time pressure. right?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so what he's trying to do is make the study a little more interesting. unfortunately, he's got a confound (built with the beginning.) yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, it's not like,          <EVENT DESC="COUGH"></EVENT>          excuse me, externally v- valid because, how can you really say that thinking of uses for, an army compass or a monkey wrench, are, gonna be examples of creativity? (or they measure them?)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay right so there may be, an external or ecological validity issue um, certainly yeah if, you know, if creativity has nothing to do with, (u-) uses for a monkey wrench, then, then you don't really have, much validity. good. um,          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> which, which </OVERLAP1>
          validity was that?          <OVERLAP1> external </OVERLAP1>

          external validity, you could also argue for ecological validity. if you, were trying to use creativity as a way of, sort of measuring how well people will do in in the world. so, mere exposure. by the way the name of this guy is E A J O N C, it's pronounced zionts, rhymes with science. he, was at Michigan for most of his career he just moved to Stanford a few years ago. um, but he had the coolest name in psychology. um,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> this is a pretty dumb study </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, despite the (xx) kind of a dumb study, so what's wrong with it? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) (here?) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well first of all the, the first list of words could've had like more positive connotations, or, better related to, and then like the second list of words could be words that they didn't even know, and stuff_ it didn't say what kind of, what like_ did they match the words to see if they were like same, like difficulty level and length and all that stuff? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm okay now since the task was to, to judge the words from the first list, that everybody saw, how would you think that the differences in the second list would make a difference?          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          so (if) the words in the second list let's say they have negative connotations and the words in the first list have positive connotations, the task is to recall, or to to judge the words in the first list. how do you think, the fact that the words in the second list are negative, would make a difference?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it would make the first list look better. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but no, l- if, </OVERLAP1>
          yeah, make the first list look better. or you could, reverse it, and like, the other list (looks) better. so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay but, (what) i'm not sure is wha- wh- where what's causing the effect? so right before you make the judgment of the first list of words, of whether they're positive or negative, you see a se- either a new list of words that are different, or you see that same first list. and you do be- and you rate the first list better. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) the first list </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> what's that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> there's nothing to compare to if you see the first list again. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so maybe you have to think (xx) compare (xx) (you'd) sort of just judge 'em all positive. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, but didn't you say like you see a list and you s- might see the same list again and you decide whether you like those words? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, so what he's trying to show_ what this th- th- this_ was was he did a bunch of studies, in addition to this one some of 'em were better than others. in one, in one case he used subliminal presentation, and what he would do is people would be looking at a screen, and he would subliminally present, shapes, unusual shapes, not necessarily squares and circles but unusual shapes. and then, they didn't know that they saw these things and the- they were looking at them for like a millisecond, so it was way too, fast to even recognize that you saw something. and then later on you would give 'em a big, list of shapes and ask them to rate how positively or negatively they felt. and, what he found was that, um...          <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          the old, the new, the old shapes, were rated, more positively than the new shapes. so, what he's saying is that, these ideas that mere exposure, just seeing something once, will make you feel more positive about it, than seeing something, seeing it for the first time. so, in this particular study what he's doing is, instead of giving 'em shapes that they don't s- or things that they get subliminally he's presenting it, um so that it's, conscious. so they see a word, they see another word and then a week later they come back and they either see the same list or a different list. so that that particular method introduces a new confound. and, i i think that y- you're getting at at the point, it has to do with the types of words that you're presented with, part of it. can you think of some things that, that could lead you to, rate the old list better after having seen that a second time than having seen, a new list of words?          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          who's confused? mhm, go.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S10" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it also seems like well even outside of that like, a week has passed between them and so, there's all kind of things that can affect how you feel about a certain, group of words or even just,          <U2 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like what? </U2>
          what your mood is, what your mood was last week and what your mood is this week, will affect like, how you rate, a list of words.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, would you think that that, that the mood would, differ between people who saw the same list twice and the people who saw, two different lists?          <PAUSE DUR=":04" ></PAUSE>          just remember that's the point of a confound. yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the second list might put people in the bad mood.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          (xx)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. maybe reading the second list does something to people, that, reading the first list doesn't do to them. so it might be for example that, if the second list includes some negative words people might be in a bad mood, and in a bad mood they might rate everything lower. so, that might be what's causing the problem. um, so it's kind of what you're saying is the idea that they might be in a different mood, but y- what you need to be able to say is that, something in one condition caused their moods to change differently than in the other condition. mkay? so let's talk about blackout babies have any of you guys ever heard that, about after a blackout there's, a rise in births? so, what's wrong with that? yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (if you look at the, the results and then you might be saying) (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, y- you're saying that that, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (it just might be, it just might happen that they might just have decided on Monday or Tuesday.) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so it might not be nine months after it might be Monday Tuesday. right. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um i also don't (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay right, so, so rather than looking at Monday and Tuesday you're saying, to say take the the week before and the week after the date, nine months later than the date, compare that to other times that (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> (xx) </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> correct. right. now now part of that is, part of this is is good the fact the_ in fact it turns out that um, there's about a week a standard deviation of uh, of birth is, is about a week in either direction, so there's nine months then plus or minus is a week. (so you can see what these are) so, getting getting a bigger picture would be better. but, you could imagine if, that standard deviation occurred all the time, the year before the same type of standard deviation occurred. um and it wasn't you know there weren't as many          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="SNEEZE"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> (on Monday and Tuesday as compared to) </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="SS" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="U" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> bless you </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          Wednesday Thursday Friday. it it ends up turning out that, that um, a lot of births aren't natural sort of, you know, the babies coming let's rush to the hospital ones, a lot of 'em are induced, um and then there are cesareans. and, doctors tend to induce pregnancy and to do ce- cesareans early in the week, as opposed to before the weekend. because, they're gonna be at work the rest of the week so they can check up on the mother whereas if they do it on a Friday and then go, away for the weekend, the mother's in more trouble. so in fact, somebody, did a follow-up on this because it seemed a little odd, and what they found, was that if you, look at it by day          <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          (xx) it looks like this basically. actually it probably dips down a little bit (xx) so, you have this kind of, fact where, there're just more births on Monday and Tuesday than there are on other days of the week. and somebody looked at the nine weeks before and the nine weeks after, looked at Monday and Tuesday versus the other days and they found that there was a significant difference. so the fact that there were more births that day, didn't really mean as much, because, it was all part of a pattern. and in fact, there weren't more births nine months after the blackout than, at other times. (xx) so. yeah?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> but there there weren't? couldn't it just be that, on that Monday of that particular week they were like so much higher than all the Mondays on the rest of the year? the- or they didn't find that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it it could have been, if if that were the case. right you would effect_ you you would expect that there were a main effect, of that year versus other years, (you're assuming that that was your particular interest,) if there were a main effect, you might expect this.          <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          right with this being this year, the year of the blackout this being the year before or after the blackout. (okay) and you can still see this pattern, right, Mondays would still be more than Thursdays, but what you would say is that, there's a main effect because two years differ, and there's no interaction because they're parallel. mkay? so, and but that doesn't, negate the fact that there's still a main effect for day of the week. so... what you should be able to get out of this is the fact that, even studies that get published and that look good, can have confounds. and your job when you come up with your final projects, is to try to get rid of as many confounds as you can, and ideally, you should think of a problem in the world, and try to operationalize that problem and try to run a study on that. um and, i think what i can do is, just to get you thinking about this... i'll hand out um, a description of the final project, um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-f" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's due April seventeenth right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it's due at the end of the semester. but there're different things going, going on between, now and then. um, the key that you should keep in mind is that you can work with a partner, in groups of up to two no more than two, and, um, if you work with a partner you guys can both run the same study and everything and you do it all together but you have to write up separate papers. and, your grade isn't based on whether you find significance it's based on, how you, can present the data and, how you um, how you run your analysis and how you basically show that you understand all the stuff we've talked about this semester. now fortunately, during the whole semester, you guys have gone through, all the different parts of, writing a paper so this shouldn't be too difficult. you've written, an intro, a methods, a results, and a discussion section, so you can look back at those and and, and directions that we've given you throughout, throughout the semester. so, start thinking about ideas, start thinking about partnering up if you want, um and starting next class we'll we'll get into, more depth as far as what your projects are gonna (be like.) so, for those of you who haven't handed in, your assignment four and you need help doing the analysis stay here for a little bit, otherwise i'll talk to you Monday. </U1>
