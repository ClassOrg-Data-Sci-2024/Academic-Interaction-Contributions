         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          most of the things like i said, big parts of the paper were, how people socialize in Howell,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          um how people socialize in Novi, and why people go to the mall          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> great. now, um, you m- you might though i don't know i mean and this is not so important for the paper but, i think this introduction sounds really good. um, you_ it's written really clearly and stuff. um, now i worry, whether you are capturing by interviewing your grandmother, um, that you're capturing what people do in Howell, or whether you're capturing an older, form of socializing, that still remains in Howell especially among older people. um, so you might i- it doesn't change your argument necessarily, but you might wanna qualify it in that kinda way          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          you see what i mean?        </U1>

          i actually did, um in a number of places, um things that she said that i uh that interested me i said you know, this is maybe why she says this or whatever.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and also i made sure to ask her like, observations that i had made like, you know i've seen people skateboarding in here you know do          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what's </OVERLAP1>
          the deal with that?          <OVERLAP1> and she said </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay so you asked </OVERLAP1>
          them about other,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          the way other people in Howell socialize          <OVERLAP1> as well </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh yeah </OVERLAP1>
          yeah        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and she has a lot of contacts,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean she </U2>
          to that community        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah she's just, she's just like_ everyone knows her in Howell, cuz she's, you know lived there, all her life and she's big into the every kinda community thing you can imagine so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> did you get a, did you get and include in here the kinds of community, things that she's involved in?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          okay good. um          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and i pulled from the Crawford          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          uh a little you know from Upscaling Downtown and then          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> also </OVERLAP1>
          from uh Fortress L-A a little bit        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay great. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh and the Detroit News article was awesome too </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          oh okay, um, you want me to make comments to you as we go along? why don't i          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> make </OVERLAP1>
          comments to you as we go along? um, now here's a place where you could pull in more, specifically um, you know partly from the Crawford i think um, but you could pull in more specifically i mean, all businesses exist to make money. right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          that's the nature of, capitalism. um, so... you gotta be a little more specific than malls exist to make money. you know what i mean? um, so, why did, does Crawford suggest and have we talked about in class that sort of that malls have developed when they have, um... to, concentrate the making of money?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, because they can um partly cuz they can be the new town square or whatever and people can,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          i guess, people can go there and, l- like everyone wants_ i talk about it later on but everyone wants you know the, national kind of brands and stuff          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          so if they put the same stores everywhere then people are gonna          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          um, you might wanna, um, explain that a little bit here just so that you tell me why that's not the kind of mall that, people socialize in, and that might help you set up the kind of description that, um i assume you're gonna do of the mall, um, of like how malls b- because of how they're built become places to socialize          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i'd just          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          throw that out          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um because uh... and i don't know how you wanna organize this,          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah i'll </OVERLAP1>
          hafta like kinda combine these but kinda          <OVERLAP1> not </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          you might wanna combine them but start with what it used to be like and how you think, the development of these stores which are like strip mall type,          <WRITING> strip, mall, </WRITING>
          developments on the outskirts of town, right? are changing          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          the way people shop. and you're right that thi- from variety stores that have everything, um, you end up going to different kinds of stores for different kinds of goods. right? um, but          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's not the yuppie kind of, um, specialization. it's another kind of specialization.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <WRITING> not </WRITING>
         </U2>
          and they aren't really taking over the downtown right? they- they're located, on the outskirts, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um and you might wanna, tie this here to_ cuz, this is not just um variety stores becoming, um these big kind of mega, specialized stores um but this is also small um, probably locally-owned stores becoming, massive, chains, no? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you mean like where people shop for all their... </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no i'm just uh,          <WRITING> stores becoming chains... </WRITING>
          no just this switch i mean this D and C, this dime store. probably somebody just, in Howell owned it right? like your grandparents' pharmacy        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm oh          <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          and you might wanna mention your grandparents' pharmacy, as another example... um, and those kind of locally-owned stores are being replaced by, um, big          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> national chains </OVERLAP1>
          on the outskirts of town.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          i mean and that, there is, you could, quote Williams for that cuz she does talk about how that may be happening in downtown, um, in the downtown and Alma Valley, or whatever it's called.          <EVENT DUR=":41" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          hm, that's interesting. so, Wal-Mart as a kind of... as a variety store. um, now, why though is Wal-Mart not serving the same function as a mall for these people?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well, uh it doesn't like have the, you know, expensive kinda, national chain stores and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's mostly geared towards, uh i don't know, like middle-class just going to get all their, like normal shopping done. i mean just normal stuff they need        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay... normal shopping </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> not like yeah not like specialized, utilitarian kinda stuff </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. now, why is that different, um than the shopping at the mall? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like to the mall you hafta get specialized you know i need, my Abercrombie shirt or whatever          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          alright so so some, it's about specialization but, uh, not only right? it's also about, fantasy, or like, stimulating other kinds of desires          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay, </OVERLAP2>
            yeah          </U2>
          so you might wanna like highlight, that distinction. Wal-Mart not about sort of shopping as recreation,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay            <OVERLAP2> okay yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          but utilitarian i think that's a good term and you wanna kind of pull out that distinction.          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay          <EVENT DUR=":09" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay... okay now you know what i think, you might in terms of organization, um... you you wanna t- give me the community events and community groups first and then give me the other things.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> cuz </OVERLAP1>
          otherwise you've gotta include sentences like that          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay? so let's just move these two, paragraphs and see you have to repeat that so and so you put this up there.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay? um here we go          <SEG TYPE="READING"> the majority </SEG>
         <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          are Howell melons really good?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah. i mean i don't like melons but          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          f- from what i hear they are        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i see          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          i see, right. alright so tell me what you think, the Howell Melon Festival does. i mean here's here's a, not real problem i mean, i've told you this before the way you write, that is sort of chatty has its pros and cons, right? i mean in the one, in one way it makes things very easy to read and that's very nice. um, but you can't let it get in the way of your argument. you can't let your argument kind of disappear as you kind of tell me this little story          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, so here's a good example of you know somewhere either at, the, end or at the beginning you have to tell me what i mean here's, you know this is gonna go away. um          <SEG TYPE="READING"> Howell has many events through the year that bring neighbors together. </SEG>
          um, you need to tell me sort of what you think, these, this festival, or or and this farmer's market, do to socializing in Howell. um, do they, does it_ and how is that different from the socializing in the malls? i mean here's, here's an example i mean, do you think that um, in these more like community events and group socializing as opposed to mall socializing, that um, people get to, know each other i mean, that people are interacting with each other in ways aren't mediated by, commodities          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> m- m- mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or goods </OVERLAP1>
          um, m- compared to malls. do you think that um, this like builds a kind of community tha- in Howell that kind of, identity and and maybe, something that actually people then, help each other out in particular ways or, tell me what you think it does.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i yeah it builds community atmosphere i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          it's like my grandma going around and saying hello i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right.            <OVERLAP2> and she </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> lets </OVERLAP1>
          people keep in contact and        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right you- tell me yeah tell me what it does. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          huh, so everyone in the community goes to the high school play that's very interesting        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i thought so too. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          right, so many strangers are moving in. um          <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          yeah you do need to bring out in this section um, that, this is not just a_ in a way Howell is lagging behind this shift, that you're talking about right? i mean, uh... maybe Howell will f- forever stay outside of, but i really doubt it          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um so and your grandmother particularly, um is a good example of um, a previous Howell. that is in part as she says being disrupted as new people move in not totally disrupted but partly. um, so y- you'd, you even though your mom tells you, how young people socialize in Howell you you wanna recognize the way this is, a bit a representation of, Howell's past instead you know? something like that. this is a time distinction, yeah. as well as_ or an age distinction right? she's older. um          <EVENT DUR=":15" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          right.          <SEG TYPE="READING"> other community events strangers coming to the city can become part of the community... </SEG>
          what does she mean by this the golf comes second to her, socializing? to socializing with her friends?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> like in other words like if if, it was you know, oops i just hit that thing          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          if, she, she wouldn't, do it if it was just golf. i mean, the only reason she does it is because, she gets to talk to her friends just like          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          she golfs as a way to bring them together,          <OVERLAP1> you know </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          well you need to say that because this doesn't actually, connect the socializing and the golf it sort of says, it it could mean, she skips golf when her, friends want her to go to coffee          <OVERLAP1> or you know </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> oh okay </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so... um now did your grandmother explicitly say that strangers join the, um... golf league and stuff like that and can become part of the community? or did she not say that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> did she explicitly say it? uh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> cuz if          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i dunno what did she say? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's just your attempt to make a </OVERLAP1>
          connection between the two drop it. if not, it's a substantive claim.        </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> where did she talk about the (community...?) she said, the whole- the neighborhoods are still closely knit but not the whole c- the city as a whole,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          it's getting bigger strangers are moving in        </U1>

          i think so.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i'll put it down here to put it somewhere. um so i'd just drop that actually.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay... um, and you wanna say, uh, instead of strangers, but you wanna say something about your grandma and community groups right? what what community groups do.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
         <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          uh do, how shape, how do they shape socializing right?        </U1>

          do they join the same groups together or does she make friends through the groups or both?        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you might wanna... pull that out a little bit. um... now do you think_ again, do you think, cuz i think this is an older person thing. do you think this is an older person thing, or do you think kids do this too? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> about, like church and volunteering at the hospital?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i would </OVERLAP1>
          just assume it's          <OVERLAP1> an older </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> alright. </OVERLAP1>
          so, let me know it's an older, person thing.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          it doesn't undermine your argument for, that to be the case.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          in a way, it's just that you're s- eh then you just need to emphasize more clearly at the outset that, the comparison is partly cuz Howell is a more um, has historically been a more blue-collar, middle-class, place. um, now new gated communities are moving in, right? no          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> in Novi, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's Novi, Novi </OVERLAP1>
          never mind. um          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um that may be changing, in Howell i mean Howell may be becoming more, upper middle-class or whatever, um, but uh... the form of socializing that you're describing in Howell, um... is in part, you know seen through the view of your grandmother and thus in part, something that is about the long term community that's been there, right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um so about like, people with h- history in, so it's not really in some sense a typical, transient suburb. it's about people with a history and a place, um and that maybe the newer residents moving in, um and some of the younger residents, don't have those same kinds of socializing networks that are like built up in that place over time.          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          so when you're laying out the comparison between Novi and Howell in the beginning, you probably wanna say that kinda thing right? and maybe even in that paragraph where you start to describe, um, what your uncle says about Novi. no no that's Novi never mind.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          um, okay that's good, okay here you go... okay this is a very awkward sentence.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah it is          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>

          um, cuz here we've got, okay. the first sentence which is to me a really important point that you should talk more about, right? um what does it mean that the socializing is not tied to shopping for your grandmother, right? why do you think that's important? um, and and you can talk about this exception being Wal-Mart. um but you know here, you you can just drop this, right?          <SEG TYPE="READING"> it wouldn't be unless a mall moved in that </SEG>
          first of all it's incredibly awkward          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, uh, and this is a separate point. more and more people are moving into Hower Howell um, and you're asking so- sort of_ so i think you should expand this into a, real paragraph where you say why you think that's important. um, and this is a separate paragraph now, you can't give me an answer to this question. it is an interesting question. um, you might wanna put it in a footnote instead. do you know how to use footnotes?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, cuz... um, i mean and these are two separate things right? i mean you can't answer the question about why there's no mall been built. maybe it's a question of time. um, maybe there's a mall close enough. um, is there a mall close enough or is there a mall pretty far away...? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh there's, i think there's kinda one in Brighton </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. how far away is that? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> maybe fifteen, minute          <OVERLAP1> drive </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          right maybe that's close enough so they don't need to build a mall. um, so i would actually drop this question, about why no mall.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you can't </OVERLAP1>
          answer it, um          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          uh, put it in a footnote, something like that, that'd be fine. but now this, um, i mean you might wanna, have this somewhere in here but it might not belong right here. the strangers moving in it might belong_ you mentioned sort of, strangers moving in, up, above somewhere right? instead of changing the socializing          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm mhm </U2>
          or you might wanna like make this into a real paragraph. where you look at um, sort of how, Howell may be changing, right? but without the question of sort of the mall, right...? and and, here's where maybe you can make the point about your grandmother's world being a slightly older world in Howell          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and maybe the new residents aren't participating in these community networks maybe they go hang out at the mall, we don't know, right? um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          so          <WRITING> grandma's, Howell um, as older Howell </WRITING>
          of sort of, long-term residents... and then the newer are disrupting in some sense. does that make sense?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay... okay. blah, blah blah blah gatch gatch gatch gatch ga- too chatty.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          okay. ma- tell me yeah. resi- um, you might wanna switch this sentence around so you say, in com- you know um, unlike Howell, unlike sort of, older residents in Howell... residents of Novi, go to the mall to socialize. um, uh          <SEG TYPE="READING"> unlike older residents, residents from Novi go to the mall to s-... </SEG>
          or or you could say unlike older residents in Howell, who depend on groups, community groups and events, residents of Novi go to the mall to socialize. that would work. you just gotta make, you gotta put Howell in there          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          instead of just people. um, good. uh going to the mall is like, is, is an event          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> in itself yeah </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no it can't be a liability thing. i mean it must be in a way... since a mall is dependent so much on like, image right? i mean malls, are not about utilitarian shopping they're          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> about, </OVERLAP1>
          promoting some kind of, image of a, fantasy place right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          maybe in a way it's just that they wanna make sure, that their image is protected and so they wanna make sure that the, their official P-R people do all the talking instead of any employees. and that would be my,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          theory.          <EVENT DUR=":14" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>         <SEG TYPE="READING"> the mall is a family event. </SEG>
          that's great. now i would put these, i'd put these two, and here's a place where i think again your um chattiness is gonna interfere with your argument. um, this stuff about family is really interesting. um, and, you wanna put it into one paragraph. and give me an argument about, the mall as a family event. right? one paragraph. did she, actually_ is that a quote from her?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> which one? </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i know it's very hard to take notes isn't it...? um... well i mean i i like that framing of it whether she said it in those terms or not, i mean ma- the mall as a family event right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so just say like... </OVERLAP1>
          she might be saying this, in order to promote the idea that the mall is safe for families. she might, but          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          she might not          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but you know you don't need to, go into it but, i think you need to, again analyze this a little bit more in terms of, um, a- and we- we'll have to see what you do later on if, malls, if families socialize in malls... ouch... you know what's, what's that mean? what's that about? what's the significance of that? how's that different from Howell? you might just wanna like again sort of draw out some conclusions from this a little bit. now you may be, you may have a section in the end where you draw out a bunch of conclusions about this comparison i don't know so we'll s- wait until we get there.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          mkay so we have families, we have old people          <EVENT DUR=":08" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          now, here's a thing. you wanna think, and this is actually true for both of these. the mall has set itself up to be this kind of socializing place it's not just accidental, that it's the socializing place. you wanna make that clear in both of these paragraphs. do you see what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          so, the mall has a mall walking program, the mall has this, thing for small children. right? so you wanna explicitly say, malls are s- you know, and why. right? now i know you're gonna say you're gonna say why eventually but you might wanna do it up front. are set up, to be social centers... how and why i mean you've got the, you've got the how here it's just you haven't made that connection. make sense?          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          nyah, i'll be right back.        </U1>

          right it doesn't say, so so that's, i think that's a good point but you also wanna say, what, window shopping itself does, right? cuz this is about arriving with different sets of wants not about window shopping entirely          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U2>
          okay?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i thought </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          she does talk about it she talks about trying on commodities window shopping as trying on commodities and this is sort of what you're saying. in the back of_ they feel that they need many different things but can't actually afford to buy them. so window shopping is a way of like          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          satisfying that desire. so you wanna say window shopping is a form of satisfying that desire not, just socializing right? cuz that makes your argument more complicated.          <EVENT DUR=":22" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay          <EVENT DUR=":11" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          uhuh yeah          <EVENT DUR=":14" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          okay          <EVENT DUR=":17" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          alright this is good          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          that's very nice.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> cool </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> out </OVERLAP1>
          or move or something. um, because, if you wanna talk about, the mall being successful as bringing people there to socialize you should talk about it where you're talking about that          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh. </U2>
          alright now, from what i see you don't have, let's see da da da da da... okay right... okay. um, you don't have later, something where you talk about um, why, the malls want people, to come, and be social and window          <OVERLAP1> shop </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i guess </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you you </OVERLAP1>
          want that. because that ties together, these arguments, right? this ties together the family, the old people, why there are, restaurants why there are, movie theatres right? that, malls are designed, to be social centers tied to, places where you buy things. so you really wanna look back at Crawford's argument about, malls as sort of fantasy lands, um, to stimulate, consumer desire, right? and you wanna, use that, maybe to introduce this section, or to conclude this section or something. cuz that's a really important argument.          <EVENT DUR=":12" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>       </U1>

          um, if you're like a private uh you know not chain store. so you might wanna talk about chain stores, here. but, your, the point about the mall system dominating real estate, re-          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          no retail, sales um, doesn't necessarily belong here i mean this might be, something that you, use earlier in the paper to set up the importance of malls, right? earlier... but it doesn't belong here... okay...          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          alright so so maybe in fact, you s- um, you could have a paragraph about brand names and chain stores right? and then, um, have a second paragraph... um, or second sort of point about uh, because of national advertising, through advertis- you know this point, um... advertising and the malls themselves right? and sort of, the malls, themselves, as people are window shopping etcetera, which is in and of itself advertisement          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm... </U2>
          right. um... make people, feel like they have to, own these brand name clothes. right?          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          and that the most important things, are you know wearing these brand names on your body so are this, is this clothing point, right? no. i think it is true. okay... um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          you know uh... this is true throughout this paper. it's it's at a pretty good stage i mean you've got a good, um, discussion of your primary materials, it seems to have like a basically good organization, i mean you need to you know fiddle like i've been suggesting fiddling, um, and tighten up at some points. now may be the time to ask yourself, how else this fits in with other readings that we've done. cuz so far we're a little bit short on that kind of connection, right? um, and we've talked a lot in this class about, um, using clothes to proclaim a certain kind of status now, um... there's not a reading that's gonna make the point that you need to make here exactly. but if you looked at In Search of for, for Respect or something like that, um, he might make a similar point about clothing right? about symbolic capital. in fact he, definitely does.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          um, and of course uh, it has a different meaning to the kind of upper middle-class people that come to the mall than for the crack dealers. um but you wanna think about those kinds of, categories that we've thought with in this class a little bit and see if they can, if you can use them in your analysis in some way, right? to expand exactly like this point, what it_ why do people feel like, they can, obtain a certain status? what do we mean by that, you know? um, why is it through clothes? um... so you wanna, yeah. you wanna think about those kinds of ways of making connections. and, i think even uh, doesn't Crawford make the point that that's more important in suburbs, um or in in th- in actually modern, the way America is, most Americans live now, no matter where they live, um, b- because you don't live in a sort of fixed community where people, know your whole history and stuff?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          right? so you, probably wanna, um, they don't know your connections they don't know your family they don't know you so you, the          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh, yeah </U2>
          th- the statement you make with, the consumer items that you wear becomes more important now that may not be so important in Howell. certainly not important for your grandma. cuz she has all those connections.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? so you wanna, think about those kinds of theoretical moves that, Crawford and um Bourgois, um, make. in non- ne- the sort of, the traditional sociology term for this is non face-to-face communities. you don't need to use that but that's what i'm writing down here just as a shorthand for that argument.          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
            okay          </U2>
          and, my shorthand for um In Search of Respect is I-S-R... so probably actually what you should do is go back and actually just, um, read this one more time, go back and read the Crawford one more time, and see if there're any sort of other sort of arguments that help you out. um,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          look at your notes from the class think about the symbolic capital stuff in In Search for Respect, and then figure out how to weave those into what you've got here, you know? you don't need to restructure it entirely but just where are they gonna let you, dra- and you know several places i've said you should um, expand, like, um, like this point of people feeling pressure to buy clothes from stores right? from these brand names so that's you can use them to, expand that argument about the meaning of brand names in contemporary society and why they're so important, right? we know they're important          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm mhm </U2>
          um, but why? and why not maybe for your grandma? and why for people who go to malls in, Novi? um          <EVENT DUR=":13" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          so um, Abercrombie's more expensive than American Eagle?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh yeah. it's          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

          um, and it, probably goes          <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="LOOKING THROUGH PAPERS"></EVENT>          yeah i mean it probably goes right here. or somewhere like that, right? and you need to set this argument up for me of malls as socializing spaces... and and, you need to um, in that you should look at Crawford for her argument of how, socializing and buying get linked right? and then you can go through, your family, you know that th- th- this takes different forms for different, people right? you've got families, you've got old people, you've got youth, right?        </U1>

          transition        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, um... i don't exactly know what it's about either. um, mall jobs don't pay good wages.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they're </OVERLAP1>
          pretty badly paying service jobs. um, so it makes sense that, young people would get them. um, and it makes sense that retired people might get them to supplement, their income. there're also probably not, a lot of them even full-time. like they often hire you know part-time casual labor, um... so it's an interesting question it's, it very possibly could be that um, these are you know, displaced workers in some sense. um, and that um... you know displaced from i don't know what but uh... and they've had to take significant, pay and status cuts working at the mall. so i mean that's just an interesting_ to think about i- you can't probably get the answer to it but, um... alright so, um... so it seems pr- i mean it seems like you've got all the details that you need. what you need is a slightly clearer frame. and i think it's even like in a fine order to do the Howell stuff first then to do the Novi stuff, um, what you need to make sure you do is not, um, don't get caught up in your, transitions as much and instead like ask yourself, alright what's the argument of this section? um, have i used, the materials from_ have i used Crawford's argument sufficiently have i used, Davis' sif- sufficiently have i really argued each of the sections right? so like the security section you need to make sure and i think the security section is pretty good that's a good example. um... where'd it go? security... where'd your security section go? oh here we go. mhm, security yeah. um          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          i mean here's the here's the good place where you need to you know, um... here's a place where you could tie, this need for security need to feel safe to broader sort of transformations why do people need to feel safe right now...? you know? why need to feel safe... um, why does why does safety equal... um, fairly homogenous... um, especially in terms of class, um, social groups you know?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so there's a good opportunity for you to, look outward a little bit and, ask how this connects to some of those bigger things we've been talking about. so look for other opportunities to do that and you can- you don't need to write whole paragraphs about that right you just need a couple of sentences that, will help, actually structure, help, highlight and structure your argument. um, and then it'll be totally great. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          is the, was the end okay? i mean        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i mean like </OVERLAP1>
          you- i know in my first outline you told me to try and, make broader,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          conclusions about how it          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> affects </OVERLAP1>
          our culture but i couldn't          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          figure out you know, like exactly how to_ so i just asked the question          <OVERLAP1> you know? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          asking the question is good now, um, Davis and Crawford. you're right they don't actually give, great answers but they they give some answers, right they s- they suggest it does ac- some things. do you agree with them or not...?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i guess i don't </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i dunno i mean you know maybe partly maybe not entirely um, uh, yeah i mean these are really good questions. i don't expect you to be able to answer them. right? i mean, these are big questions. um, but you          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          that's very cute. um... it might be fine to end with these kinds of questions. um, but you need to... um make this a little more, expand this a little bit more, right? so what have you argued in this paper? remind me. right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, and then you, you might wanna, um discuss a little bit more, i mean okay. why would maybe, um, the consumer connec- sorta the connection between consumer, um, well the connection between buying whatever and socializing, that you find in in the mall in Novi, why, might that strengthen or weaken the social fabric of America?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          i mean y- you wanna, i mean those are good questions but, um you haven't like laid ou- you know, why might they? um, and you know Davis and Crawford have some answers right? i mean they suggest that, malls increase sort of segregated socializing experiences, um, make people more fearful, of strangers, in some ways because, we're more fearful of uncontrolled environments, because they expect a certain level of security. um, do, um... you know Davis, suggests more sort of fundamentally that socializing through commodities, has a negative effect on relations between people. you at least wanna think about that argument. you don't have to agree with it or y- or disagree with it necessarily but you wanna_ maybe you could do it in terms of questions but you need the questions to be more s- um, more textured more substantive more, more elaborated so, you see what i mean?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, yeah. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, and partly i think when i say that, um, i also just want you to be making those connections as you go through about malls you know, stimulating consumer desire right? um, about uh, what else...? um, you know you might want to in the section that you're talking, um, well maybe not. um          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          oh and about sort of um, malls as spaces that um, connect uh, socializing and, um, buying right? i mean the kind of point of Crawford          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so you just wanna draw out those points and use them partly as a frame for your analysis. you look about as tired as i am.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm? i'm tired          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> but no this is this is totally great and um, you know since you've done this much work already and you've got five days left to finish it, you're gonna be totally fine          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. other questions for me? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, uh d- do y- did i do a reasonable job like... like on this you wrote, you know right here you said broader economic shifts and here you          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> said, </OVERLAP1>
          culture more broad did i do an okay job of trying to, i          <OVERLAP1> mean </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          i'll have to expand a little bit about you know at the end here the questions          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          well um, you haven't made the connection to the economic shifts right? i mean, do you see what i mean by that? um... i've suggested places that you can, right? so, um, both, when you're looking at what stores are in, the mall right?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          thinking about um how, malls are good examples of, uh, the way consumption is now organized in terms of really like narrow, um, sort of class markets right? whereas we used to have Sears now we have like, a mall for people at exactly these incomes and this neighborhood and a mall for people with exactly these you know          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um so, that information is here, but that point isn't, you know you haven't made that argument. so you should work to do that um, the other sort of obvious place to do that um, in terms of the, uh          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          oh um w- you know one is in the security, right? why now?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um, and in part it's uh, you know, the question of fear of crime being a sort of broader cultural phenomenon right? people are sc- people are scared because of media representation for all sorts of reasons um and partly because uh, there are a lot of, really really poor people          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, there are a lot of homeless people, and, um... that kind of, ex- increasing inequality, um, you got lots of strategies for dealing with it right? and the strategy we're kind of engaged in now is a strategy of making sure people just stay away from each other and then feel safe, right? um, so, there's another place where you can, you know make that broader, a a connection to sort of broader both cultural and sort of economic things going on. does that make sense?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          other questions...?          <OVERLAP1> alright </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> nope </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          now, how- wait okay they're, lemme talk about first the details that you have since we don't really have a, structure          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          to talk about yet.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and then we can talk about how to get that structure. um... here's what occurs to me in most of this.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          and and it's fine to do this first, a kind of exercise          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          in description. it's totally cool. the next step, and that will help you sort of craft your argument. is, to, analyze this stuff          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> more so </OVERLAP1>
          right like um you don't want to do a um, whole description of, the um, booths at the festival, listing          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          they do, without sort of          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> analyzing </OVERLAP1>
          as you go along          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          cuz otherwise you'll just have to be repeating yourself or something          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so. um, you wanna see sort of what clusters i mean just talking about the booths          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          the stuff, fall into so you've already got a couple clusters you've got, the, um, uh, organizations, sort of          <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          nonprofit organizations. um, and, um, i don't know if you, got any more of a sense, from the literature that they had at those, um special like the National African-American Parent Involvement or the Community Learning Post, um, what, they thought they were doing at the festival or          <OVERLAP1> why </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          they were there or did you did you get any sense of,          <OVERLAP1> the organ- those organizations? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, the </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> whatever </OVERLAP1>
          it was          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          they didn't have, at least i didn't see that they actually had any literature          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that they </OVERLAP1>
          were really campaigning for anything they had a lot of photographs, it was more like this is what we've done          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm,            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> than, </OVERLAP1>
          like recruiting i mean like uh Planned Parenthood and NARAL were there actively, they were there actively to, ca- you know they had petitions to sign and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          leaflets to hand out and,          <OVERLAP1> the paren- </OVERLAP1>

          what the? yeah go ahead        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the parents' organization really just seemed to be more of a, report          <OVERLAP1> than a </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right right </OVERLAP1>
          we have this,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's just like annual, involvement          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> day </OVERLAP1>
          and, you should do it or whatever.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, what do you know what kinds of things, that Planned Parenthood and National Abortion Rights had um... had, literature about or things to sign or?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um there wa- NARAL had a, petition          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> s- abortion rights okay          <OVERLAP1> so just kind of generalized </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and then, and then </OVERLAP1>
          just a general_ they have like, it's actually kind of a nice brochure but they_ it's just a really vague general sort of, this is your right blah blah blah.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so nothing, no kind of specifically          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> no </U2>
          targeted          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or anything </OVERLAP1>
          okay. um... yeah, they may in fact especially those two organizations that are historically fairly white organizations, um, may have tried really actively to, um... may try actively to go to sort of,          <OVERLAP1> local African American community festivals and stuff </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm, mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          and there was one other group that was there but they didn't have a booth they were walking around did you see them?          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i </OVERLAP1>
          don't think so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> now what were they?          <EVENT DESC="LOUD BACKGROUND NOISE"></EVENT>          they were_ they had_ it was two organizations working together um, boy is that loud, um, one, was the um was the Friends, um,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          American Service, Co- ooh what do they call themselves? American Service Committee?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i          <OVERLAP1> ye- some- yeah </OVERLAP1>

          um, and they have a um, prison project, actually          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          um locally so they were passing out information about their prison project, and um, the Ann Arbor Fair Housing, League was        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay i missed both of those          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's okay that's okay, um was passing out um, uh, flyers about their, housing testing          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          and requesting volunteers, um, of all ages, races, sexes, though they generally need more men cuz they've got more women          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          um uh to, go do housing testing, so those are two additional organizations          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          but, um, none of these organizations may add very much to your argument because...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> they didn't          <OVERLAP1> do much </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> well, </OVERLAP1>
          whatever yeah they're there i mean, they're there as_ i mean and it's important to think of, i mean they, what is the significance of being, them being there? i mean, whether you see them doing much or not what, what could you say the significance of them being there? why are they there in some sense and?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, </U2>
          cuz if we can't have any kind of reason, you may as well put them          <OVERLAP1> in the footnote </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> leave it out </OVERLAP1>
          right          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um... ah they probably just saw it as an opportunity, where there would be a lot of people in one place          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          to reach an audience that they may not otherwise have reached.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. okay so and right it may be partly to sort of expand their audience and to          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          increase sort of diversity. um... i mean it may also be in part an, a kind of recognition of, um... the, political importance of the African-American community          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          that may be also a reason that the Learning Post wants them there you          <OVERLAP1> know? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          um, uh... i mean both, like they want them to be part of their organizations because it increases their sort of base and political power          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but um, also especially the Friends and um, the, housing activist ones, are kind of, um, none of those are organizations that are actually centered in the African-American community but they are organizations, that have historically had those kinds of links          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and, </OVERLAP1>

          um so        </U1>

          um, okay now, the merchandise i mean, what kinds of, themes do you see coming out of, the, i mean okay thinking of the question, how this festival is representing an African-American community          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          what, how it's defining that community through the kinds of things that it's selling. um, we've got sort of, a sort of food tradition we've got maybe some political, tradition,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          what are the different um and not necessarily consistent with one another but the different, um, themes that come out of the, stuff that they're selling?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, there was definitely a lot of... a lot of like racial pride,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but not </OVERLAP1>

          they would have political leaders and singers and you know, all, jumbled in together without any distinction between,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          the two.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay so racial pride, some of which is expressed through, um, leaders. so like          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right okay so. you want probably to take, i mean that is one category and you wanna think about what          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um and through these_ wh- and why th- mixing the great her- the great political heroes with the great, cultural,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> icons. </OVERLAP1>
          you wanna think about that and tell me          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why </OVERLAP1>
          you think those are all mixed together.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay i mean, for one it's, i mean it is partly just uh, you know, a t-shirt company selling lots of t-shirts          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          it's, you know, the person who bought those t-shirts and put them all there together,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          thought that those were_ those all belonged together in          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> some, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> why? </OVERLAP1>
          um uh, and, i mean that's a point, where you can also think about the, um... stuff that Robin Kelly sort of talked about the kind of play, the sort of paths to, success.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          um, alright so um, you're gonna wanna give some thought to, i mean first of all does does that kind of African connection make its way into any of the other literature of the Community Learning Post, does it not? it doesn't seem to be important in          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> no </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright. um, then you need to think about why it's there i mean          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it's um, it may not um, in fact what, why is it called the Community Learning Post?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i- </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right          <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> in a way </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah so um, figure out if you can what its history is you may be able to          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> even </OVERLAP1>
          just look on the web actually.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, okay so the Afri- i mean the African, sort of just, ever-present sort of cultural, presence          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          uh in terms of sort of, commodities i mean is, um, is true i think pretty frequently in African-American communities right? like          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> when </OVERLAP1>
          people dress up they'll often dress up in nice African,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> outfits </OVERLAP1>
          um, even you know this ninety-year old woman i was, mentioning is actually the woman i've, i wrote her life history and she_ you read one of her, stories          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          in, the Chicago thing the one that i wrote. um, and she went to Africa once. and she felt no kinship whatsoever i mean she was just like, it was dirty, i_ it had nothing to do with me,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i'm not Af- you know, but nonetheless,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, she wore African dresses          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and stuff </OVERLAP1>
          all the time. um so there's a way that that, um, those connections to a kind of African culture and presence have been fully sort of just incorporated into kind of daily life          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in some </OVERLAP1>
          way. um, and, into African-American culture          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like, </OVERLAP1>
          um even when they're divorced from the more political or um, uh, even explicit, um, claims of sort of historical continuity with          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Africa </OVERLAP1>
          or something um, so where some of that is clearly there with the Cleopatra and the, i mean claiming sort of, ancient, heroes. so-          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          sort of creating an African-American history, and culture with connections to Africa          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          has been repeatedly denied.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, is important. it it, it's become such a part of, um community self-definition that it doesn't have to be articulated it can just          <OVERLAP1> kind of </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          be, um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> everyone knows what it means.          <OVERLAP1> it's not that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right it c- it can </OVERLAP1>
          just kind of be there in those objects          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          so you wanna kinda think about that and analyze that a little bit um, okay, now what else? and this is you know th- here's a g- another here's a place where we have, um in dialogue, with outside definitions, of African-American culture. right? because it's in dialogue with a long history of academics,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and other folks who've said African-Americans don't, have cultural connections to Africa,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and, Egypt is not black          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          African and you know          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> la-de-da. </OVERLAP1>
          um, so uh, i mean this i- i think, is, can be a useful theme, for you to tie several sections of this together it's not gonna you know, it may become part of your thesis          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not </OVERLAP1>
          purely,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but, i see a lot of the elements that you're talking about as coming together around that kind of, um, and and you might wanna think about, uh In Search of Respect as          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, som- as a book that_ and and Upscaling Downtown both, as having some places that you might be able to look for, theoretical frames for thinking about sort of community self-definition.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          and um, and oppositional community self definition in some sense.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U1>
       <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and you wanna think i mean, as_ again back to the sort of big framing question,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          um, you wanna think about uh, thinking about the festival, as a a- in the terms that Brett Williams does his sort of uh, moment outside of, time and          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          normal time and space where you can kind of, um, reorder, the world          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          in, in a way that uh... you know, kind of challenges, overturns,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          plays with, the normal order          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? um, so. i mean you know it's- one's pushing it a little bit to, analyze it in those terms but i think there's something true about that.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay so, what else, other categories.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well the, respect the black man and then the protect ba- black families          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, the, the emphasis on, family,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh, okay </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> too i mean cuz in </OVERLAP1>
          a way they do kind of go together i mean this is, taking images that are, i mean, okay. i mean for the in the images one i mean it's_ what is it doing?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well it's, it's appropriating white images and making them black. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. so right in your words          <WRITING> appropriating... white images and making them black... </WRITING>
          why...?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, why?          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i think that that's also a direct you know... speaking to the, the popular opinion that blacks don't have culture.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay right. so i mean especially in a way the, i mean this is this is high culture          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Degas is </OVERLAP1>
          high culture          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          right? we're not talking folk culture          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we're </OVERLAP1>
          talking high culture. right so it's kind of appropriating high culture. oh but what about the religious ones? i mean cuz the Last Supper, and there were all these, African-American Jesuses and          <OVERLAP1> stuff there </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          lots of them          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, ap- takin- appropriating Christianity as a black, religion. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right... yeah. i mean, i mean obviously the the prevalence of, religious imagery i mean the church is really, important.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right right. </U2>
          um, and lots of African-American churches have, white blue eyed Jesuses in them i mean,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          probably decreasingly.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um but in the old days they definitely did... um, so what does it mean i mean so the church is really important, in, African-American life          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> or, </OVERLAP1>
          for many people, um, and, the um... so what does it mean then within that sort of context, to emphasize the sort of black Jesus.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i think it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it's not just about </OVERLAP1>
         <SIC> impropriating </SIC>
          religion right because i mean,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          you got religion        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think it's... kind of an empowerment thing.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that this </OVERLAP1>
          religion was no- was in a way forced upon_ i mean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> not in a </OVERLAP1>
          way it was totally forced upon them,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          but yet they've taken it and made it their own.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          that this is not just, them bowing to the white man's religion.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay right. yeah. i think that's a very good point. um, i mean it's also making a kind of          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          i mean it's connecting in some sense religion and politics. um,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and saying uh, you know, last time i checked like, God wasn't black or white and          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right, right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> neither you know Jesus </OVERLAP1>
          wasn't, um          <PAUSE DUR=":07" ></PAUSE>          so it's, it serves as a sort of cri- in and of itself like i mean since, so many representations of God and Jesus are white          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um the, kind of shock value of a black Jesus,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> serves </OVERLAP1>
          as a critique of sort of mainstream,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right, right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> religion right? </OVERLAP1>
          i mean it reminds people that Jesus is always represented as white,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and that that's weird          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay </OVERLAP1>
          so um, so i think both those points are important. the kind of empowerment and critique. um, good now other uh          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          other issues. other, top- other things we haven't,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> about </OVERLAP1>
          what claims the festival is making what sort of          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          community_ what ways is it representing a black community.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and in what ways is that in dialogue with, in critique of in, you know whatever resistance to, outside definitions of          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> African- </OVERLAP1>
          American culture. now um          <PAUSE DUR=":08" ></PAUSE>          yeah uh now okay. now i don't know how we're gonna fit, this, part of your argument          <OVERLAP1> which i </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> in with </OVERLAP1>
          everything else          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> in with everything else now i i'm not saying you can't i          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> don't </OVERLAP1>
          think that's true at all. um, i just think that now it is not self-evident how you're going to,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, i mean here i mean here is something that this is also, so there's a kind of way that, African-American women, are actively, forming a community,          <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          community and partly through this festival.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um... so i mean in a way that is a pretty good start of, a thesis.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and when you start to define how that community is defined, through these objects etcetera          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, you'll be, um one step towards sort of, how they're trying to form a community          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and why. now i mean, now the why question_ and how you wanna organize this in a big sense,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          i dunno i mean you could, do, some of this work of like the history of the organization and, what it does, um, i mean have you gotten a sense of what it          <SEG TYPE="READING"> it offers mentoring tutoring and scholarships to </SEG>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> there          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> to- yeah </U2>
          as far as i can tell is no specific information anywhere          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          on what          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          what exactly they do and each, each article that i've read about them says something slightly          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> different uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> slightly different and </OVERLAP1>
          equally vague. so,          <OVERLAP1> i don't know </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> do we know if, </OVERLAP1>
          do we know if it has any, outside funding or if it's just a          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> don't know </OVERLAP2>

          is that where she was talking about gangs? where did the sort of gangs          <OVERLAP1> thing come up? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that's in the, </OVERLAP1>

          that she had um, she wrote herself, i don't remember if it was an article          <OVERLAP1> quoting her </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it is targeted </OVERLAP1>

          the kind of consistent thing          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yes </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>

          alright        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um... well this is, an article that was published in the Ann Arbor News, with an, interview with her and it says          <SEG TYPE="READING"> it's time to give our al- kids an alternative i wanna say you don't need gangs you've got your community right here </SEG>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right right </U2>
          and there was another similar,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          quote somewhere else        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um... a good th- a good thing for you to think about in framing the whole thing and maybe this is something you wanna do first and then go into the details          <OVERLAP1> so like, </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
          been. so, here's a place um you can talk about, some of the bigger economic shifts          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and how they've impacted, children.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and how this, and, how they've impacted children and how, um, schools, at the same time have kind of cut back on, um, or money for schools have been cut back because of, a variety of political, um, responses, uh, and so this organization is in some sense trying to f- position itself, to help people          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> kind of            <OVERLAP2> as a </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
          have been affected by this        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> kind of as a buffer or </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah yeah, um that have been affected by these sort of big economic transformations </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm, and also the current teenage population is huge.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. so </U2>
          and that's even more          <U2 WHO="S4" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="F" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> the current </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> recent </OVERLAP1>
          than          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          the last ten years.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah the current even preteen          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> population </OVERLAP1>
          is huge not the teen population yet. um, it's just starting to grow uh, yeah so th- i think those are all very good points. um, so, you wanna take every opportunity you have to, look big          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> see </OVERLAP1>
          what i mean?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          okay. other reason_ okay so that's, these are good reasons that they're starting to focus on children so that's gonna be sort of, one of the themes as you're sort of setting this up          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          you need to think about, okay if they're focusing most of their activities on children, um, how do they maybe think that the, um festival, connects to that mission of what, how does the festival connect to their mission of helping children?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think that they, are ex- they are explicitly saying that they want to show children, that there is an African-American community. that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this </OVERLAP1>
          isn't so much for adults to feel the sense of community but more so for          <OVERLAP1> children to. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay right. </OVERLAP1>
          so i mean that's a way you then bring these things          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> together. </OVERLAP1>
          um, now, the other reason that may be important and that this festival may have started when it did not the focus on children, um is what? why are they representing the Af- a kind of coherent African-American community to us now in Ann Arbor...?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh            <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
          you know this. because          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> because- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> of </OVERLAP1>
          gentrification, right?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, so you need to be thinking about, um, this festival and this organization, um representing this community, in a moment of displacement. now you've          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> got </OVERLAP1>
          something written about that which i thought was interesting. um, um, and i i'm not sure how you're gonna wanna tie this in,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but, </OVERLAP1>
          um as you're telling the sort of, i mean it- it's fine to tell us a bit of a history of the African-American community in Ann          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Arbor </OVERLAP1>
          but you've gotta figure out of, a way to make it serve your argument.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and thinking about sort of um, both_ i mean here's, um... so thinking about uh, number one why, for blacks is the nature of community, racial? um... to some degree it's because of the stuff you're talking about right? i mean community becomes, racial partly because        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> when you can't live any- when </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right when          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, so i mean that's in in part, African-Americ- their          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          their i mean they_ like we're talking about sort of racial cultures i mean there exists an African-American culture,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, which isn't singular which is multiple la-de-da we can't draw boundaries around culture, but you know that is, um, and that always is in dialogue and in interaction with          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          broader, i mean and influences in j-          <SIC> gi-normous </SIC>

         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um degree um, you know, mainstream popular culture but, i mean that kind of, distinct, communit- culture community whatever, exists um in part because of kind of an incredible history of segregation          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          so you've you've, um culture is formed through interactions with people.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, so          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          um, here's what i thought was interesting that might let you, um, draw this kind of history together so we've          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> got </OVERLAP1>
          a kind of, history of sort of segregation in Ann Arbor,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and sort of, an African-American community, growing up in that context.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          now you wanna maybe look at          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          if any of those um, if any of these like histories          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          uh, li- sort of life histories, do any of them sort of describe growing up in the community, in the African-          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i don't remember. i'll have to look through 'em again </U1>

         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          that are gonna be useful for you, in um, talking about what that, what, how people are remembering that old African community where          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

          um... now. i think this question here is very interesting.          <SEG TYPE="READING"> the literature of the Community Learning Post seems to suggest that the black community was somehow dispersed by outside forces. </SEG>
          in what way does it suggest that?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the- </U2>
          you want... if you've got, backing for this you want a paragraph for it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          because this is a way you can introduce,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          how the gentrification is being understood and this as a response to the gentrification          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in </OVERLAP1>
          some sense.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i guess it's just that there's, there's a sense of well it used to, you know it used to be that we all lived together and every- and everything was fine but now we don't even know each other. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. okay. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and so,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> interesting, uhuh </U2>
          i mean i, they don't come ou- obviously don't come out and say like we got busted up by the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> white </OVERLAP1>
          people moving in but it-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well maybe not only that right? um,          <SEG TYPE="READING"> we used to live together and now we don't know each other </SEG>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean part of it is that, that area, got gentrified and people          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> couldn't </OVERLAP1>
          afford to live there          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> part </OVERLAP1>
          of it is that people, black_ African-Americans actively wanted to,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          move into other areas of the city... and it          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> was </OVERLAP1>
          never, a huge community so          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> some </OVERLAP1>
          of it is just that, their children moved out and the          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> older </OVERLAP1>
          people died and new African-American people moved in who didn't          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> who don't,            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> have any </OVERLAP1>
          ties to,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and that's the other thing that's interesting is they're trying to pull, to say that this is the African-American community and, you know this was the historic, Ann Arbor          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know </OVERLAP1>
          this is like our home, and yet there are a lot of people who, that's_          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          who never h- knew anyone who lived there and who never lived there and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> their </OVERLAP1>
          grandparents didn't live there i mean,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          that that it's purely racial,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          it has nothing to do with how long you've lived in Ann Arbor or anything like          <OVERLAP1> that </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          right right right right. um... yeah... well i think that's something important to think about um... in the context um... of a much more mobile society          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          and this is you know true, everywhere right?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          for all people um, but maybe especially, for African-Americans who have gained a a certain amount of_ or for middle-class African-Americans, um who've gained a certain amount of mobility          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          to live in, more neighborhoods that they want          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          so then how do you, create, or maintain, sort of community ties          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          of of any kind i          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> mean </OVERLAP1>
          um, and so this festival is one way to kind of make, to reinvigorate a kind of sense of African-American identity and community sort of solidarity, um, when there isn't, at least in Ann Arbor, such segregated,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          African-American, neighborhoods where everyone must live together          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, so i think that's an important point that you wanna sort of pull out          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          um, so one is there's some dispersion by gentrification          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you wanna think about that and the other is sort of mobile society um... uh how, sense of sort of African-American community identity, is, created or, maintained, in that context when people are not, all living beside each other. okay, um... good. i mean some of this though i don- i think it's less relevant in Ann Arbor um but some of this in other_ in some of the other neighborhoods that we've read is also, communities or or just sense of sort of community identity is disrupted by fear right?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm,            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          so i don't know if you see that in any of this literature. you don't really feel it at          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> th- the </OVERLAP1>
          festival or in          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          Ann Arbor in some, real ways it's just a very different community. um, good. uh, what other pieces of this do we have, that we don't, haven't talked about? right sort of history of Ann Arbor. um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's pretty,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> straightforward </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          i mean there's not        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, does this help you start to think about sort of, an argument and a frame? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. yeah. to start to. it's gonna be hard </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean i think i think that most i mean, i think that if you pull together this stuff you have an argument and a frame i mean          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> without </OVERLAP1>
          having to like, have some incredible new insights          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
           <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that, </OVERLAP1>
          um that we haven't just already talked about.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right.            <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          so, uh, i suppose i would do some work pulling this part togeth- uh, anyway this part together          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          into an argument about sort of how it's representing the community first. and then i'd go back um, to your sort of, beginning which i don't know what your beginning is        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> this, was the beginning </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right yeah okay so here's, um, right. so that is the beginning of your,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          introduction and that's cool. um, you might wanna sort of expand it a little bit thinking about these sort of themes.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          um cuz those are the things that are gonna enable you to tie it to broader readings i mean that's the, third thing that you mustn't forget to do you're          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right, right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> good on the kind of </OVERLAP1>
          details, um, and uh, so you need to be thinking about tying to other          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> readings </OVERLAP1>
          and tying to those sort of broader themes which you know you've got some here. um so, your second section could be, um, about the Community Leaning Post in some sense, but i think you wanna do that through an kind of argument about why, um, the community needs to be represented,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          as a coherent community now,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and why </OVERLAP1>
          the focus on children. so thematically as opposed to kind of a history of the          <OVERLAP1> organization </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right </OVERLAP1>
          okay, okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay? does that help?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          no panicking          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          it's gonna be fine. and you have plenty of information don't go looking for more information        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i've got </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, and you didn't think you were going to so,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um, uh so yeah. i mean i think t- i think_ can you work on this tonight?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i think that tonight you could actually, um go to bed with the, downtown festival section, in decent shape,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and with a start on, laying out these_ this kind of          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> structure </OVERLAP1>
          and, okay maybe this'll be the argument sort of          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right            <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
          and that way you've got lots of days to finish it.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. cool </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay? </U1>

          which um, i wa- i kinda, took a st- a little step back, and just kinda looked at like the big          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> picture </OVERLAP1>
          and um, i basically realized that what Focus Hope tries to do,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          is bring Detroit up to, New York's level of where, they're in like the mainstre- i mean, they l- you know i- like that, like the first, Sugrue ari- ar- article said they were          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          the big boom town and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and that uh, that's what New York is.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          that they're trying to, come back to that, level and that they're not trying to like, because i did actually interview, Focus Hope          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          interviewed um,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> good </U2>
          a guy named John Armstrong who is, who's been there since it,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh            <OVERLAP2> that's great </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> began, </OVERLAP1>
          and yeah and so i asked him a lot about uh, about what their plans were          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> how </OVERLAP1>
          he'd sees, the th- you know all all of Detroit's problems and things like that, and i also in- interviewed one of the, counselors that works hand-in-          <OVERLAP1> hand </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> cool </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          with all, all the students. um, and, he kinda stressed the point that they're not trying to like, help everybody.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          that there's no simple s- solution but          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they're </OVERLAP1>
          just trying to get, the people that can and that and that want to          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          in into the mainstream.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and, see cuz first i thought that, Project Renewal was more          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          f- first step, and then Focus Hope was the next step but now          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i'm kind </OVERLAP1>
          of seeing the reverse.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> because </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i- </OVERLAP1>
          in what way?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> in the way that... i think first, um... if, if you help all the homeless          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          and you get them, clean          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and you get them off off the streets          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          but then there's nowhere else for them to to to go above that if, you don't kinda, deal with the whole problem of how there are no          <OVERLAP1> jobs </OVERLAP1>

         <OVERLAP1> question </OVERLAP1>

          yeah, yeah i mean i think i think you're right in thinking about, the way that they're different. i'm not sure it's gonna to be useful to you to think about whether one's first step or second step        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right yeah          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh but i think you're right that they're um, and and the the point you made about the Focus Hope in Detroit um, is interesting that in a way the um, what they're doing for the residents is, um, in bringing them into sort of the economic mainstream and in fact back to the factory working um that used to be the center of Detroit, um, is also an attempt to bring Detroit back to that, same kind of,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, economic force that it used to be so i think that's an interesting point um, now they they may have a problem.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          because um... in that it is tied to sort of the automotive industry etcetera um, it is, it's very consciously sort of looking to Detroit's past and trying to reconstruct a future, yes. go          <OVERLAP1> ahead </OVERLAP1>

          partly because, of the homeless problem. and the and the general problem of, low income housing, the city made the, very, sensible decision to, start investing lots of money in, low and middle-income housing so that_ partly to get homeless people off the streets um          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and uh, and create houses that you know even if they were, you know even if, you can't solve the problem of sort of mental          <SIC> illnessness </SIC>
          and stuff, through building housing,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm they have like a home and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i dunno, yeah </OVERLAP1>
          i mean i          <OVERLAP1> just thought it'd be </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> and you could also </OVERLAP1>
          ask them sort of what social services, work for them        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> one one thing that they said          <EVENT DESC="S2 SNEEZE"></EVENT>          here is that um,          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="SNEEZE"></EVENT>          bless you. is that homeless shelters here, um, they play, favorites          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          cuz you're not sup- i think you're not supposed to be in it for more than ninety days          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and there are people that've been in there six years          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and so, there're no beds for, these guys,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh </U2>
          and so, i dunno i just          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> uh, </OVERLAP1>

          just kinda, twisted that it's like that          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's </OVERLAP2>
            interesting          </U2>
          um, so the thesis i think,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          is gonna be... something uhh hang on, i had it in my head when i was ts- sitting in the chair over there          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it'll come back </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah basically that </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> write it down          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah that's probably a good idea          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um, </OVERLAP2>
            here you go...          </U2>
          lemme get my thoughts um, see cuz we've, like a possible thesis'd be_ we've had is_ but it's still kind of vague well_ is that, um, seeing as Focus Hope is in Detroit and then Project Re-          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          Renewal is in New York that shows the major problems of, each individual city        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, right. or, okay lemme help you reformulate that into a kind of academic thesis. um, something like um, cuz, cuz you wanna think like we've done in this class sort of repeatedly about, these organizations as both, um their resp- they look the way they do in part because of the kinds of problems they're trying to respond to right? um, uh, but, they don't themselves sort of, create those problems          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          right like in some way          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          you you might wanna say that, in order to understand um, the, programs and sort of missions of, these two organizations,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we </OVERLAP1>
          have to understand them within the context of, the, you know political and economic situations in these two cities. right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so i think that's, um, a fine, beginning of a thesis statement.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um          <PAUSE DUR=":06" ></PAUSE>          and and maybe in addition to it of of these two cities and of sort of the nation as a whole at this particular moment right that lets you like look, broader.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um because there're things that, um, these cities have in common, and that the, populations that they're trying to help have in common as well          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          so, i mean that seems to me as a good start. now... what else, what are your other thoughts about sort of the thesis and how your argument would go as it goes through?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i, i had some ideas i mean one was to kind of focus more on, the actual mission statements, and just, do a lot about that um, but then i thought that shouldn't be the f- the focus point but it should be just kind of in, you know          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i, </OVERLAP1>
          it, will be in there but not as like the main point          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think i agree with you there because,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's </U2>
          mission statements, are generally too vague to, um, i mean i think they're important to analyze and especially the Focus Hope one which is, the one i remember,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          it was interesting because it it is explicitly trying to bring, you know city and suburb together and like, through sort of service solve those, kind of big divides that have created the, disaster that Detroit is.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, so yeah so i think it's important to look at them but i wouldn't just stick, only with them        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right, um, i uh, i dunno i mean, like, it just seems that Ne- that New York and Detroit are, like they're both major, cities and Detroit during its heyday, is more comparable to New York now than,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          Detroit is now to          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> New York </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and uh        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you know who you need to think about, to think about New York and Detroit? and i can't remember if i told you this before is Saskia Sassens. Detroit is a global city.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          it is the kind of city she's talking about. um, mm in that whole book that we only read a couple chapters from.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, and i don't know if you remember but in that chapter she talks about how, um these global cities, um, have become,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh sorry </U2>
          centers that are in a way more connected to each other, irregardless of like, national boundaries,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> than to, </OVERLAP1>
          other cities in their own, country. and, that cities who have not become global cities, like Detroit, um, have lost the sort of, a lot of their economic functions and have, and find themselves_ i mean Detroit has a, particular history that's not only caused by this kind of economic change as we, learned but, um, Detroit is that kind of newly marginalized urban center um,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so she might help you, put those two cities like into connection with each other in the contemporary, moment. you see what i mean?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm.          <EVENT DESC="WRITING"></EVENT>          so should become... okay um, hm. alright... i think, i can work with this.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          definitely        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> now i've got, one caveat. um, i think this is a start for a thesis, right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i don't </OVERLAP1>
          think this can be your, the whole thing. so, as you start to_ but i think it's a fine place to start.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, start to work through these arguments, about um, how we need to understand, these organizations within their, contexts in these two, d- very different cities, which you may be able to frame as a whole, with Sassens's argument right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          and then, after you've kind of worked through that to some degree, um, and you know incorporated, your analysis of the sort of mission statements etcetera you need to be thinking about um... the economic context of these two cities, doesn't determine, what these organizations are gonna do. right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
          it sort of creates a set of problems, that these organizations are trying to respond to. right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          but they've got significant choices about, how they're gonna respond to them.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so once </OVERLAP1>
          you lay out sort of... what's, in in a way we've got a, structure and agency issue here right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the way </OVERLAP1>
          like the kind of, the structural context of these organizations, and the problems they're trying to respond to and how they're different and, um, um and how their mission statements and their organizations try to respond to them you wanna sort of, analyze, um, both like why they've made the choices that they've made,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and, what the limitations of those choices are. right? so i mean thinking about the the, film we saw today both of these organizations, have really different ways of addressing problems, than, Dudley Street.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um, there's not one way to do it right? um, but it's not that strategy it's a very different strategy, um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i mean it's it's, it's a very different strategy i think probably because, i mean they're they're two very different things in the sense that, Dudley Street, was, people that lived in like a small area          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          wanted to completely fix that while this is organization trying to_ or n- but but they're not trying to fix a whole city cuz they cuz they know that they can't        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. but they are_ i mean you're right they're focused more on a sort of economic issue less on a sort of neighborhood housing issue at least          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> in the </OVERLAP1>
          Detroit case. um, i mean one question to always ask yourself, um, is, and i've asked you this several times is, what are the implications of, once you've sort of analyzed their programs and how they're sort of, situated in this political and economic context, how um, how do their programs analyze, the problems that          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they're </OVERLAP1>
          addressed to solve right and here's the reason i ask you this question all the time. is there's a tendency in social service agencies, and i think it's probably true both of Focus Hope, and of, the other organization to some degree,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> hm </U2>
          um, to solve problems by solving individual problems. right?          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, and that's important. i'm not saying that's a bad thing. but, if, we don't think that the problems are, caused at the level of individual behavior, um then an- then solutions that are addressed, to individual behavior or education or whatever, are fundamentally limited.          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          um... so yo- you just wanna think about that and um, and you know, Bourgois obviously talks about that in his book um,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and, you wanna think ab- think about how these organizations may in fact struggle to, maintain an analysis and Focus Hope might be a good example cuz it, since it's about economics, it may be trying to kind of, help individuals while maintaining a focus on sort of, the economic history and structure of Detroit,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, ditto the_ in New York i mean they may talk a lot about um, the housing problem, a- but still focus, but still spend most of their energy on, um, dealing with, the addiction and stuff of of homeless folks which, you know according to someone like Bourgois would say it's a symptom of a sort of, problem of social marginialization it's not the problem in and of itself,          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so you gotta deal with that question          <OVERLAP1> um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          i, i actually asked, Focus          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> Hope </OVERLAP1>
          uh guy that, and, it seemed as though the, counselor was more, i don't wanna say honest but, almost down to earth as far as the organization goes because, like she works with these          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> w- </OVERLAP1>
          with these people and, you know she's the one that when they go out get and get a job they come back and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          they say, this is how how how how much money i          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i now </OVERLAP1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> all that, </OVERLAP1>
          i i mean        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. well different people in diff- in the same organization are gonna have really different analyses of the          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> problem </OVERLAP1>
          right you know, the organization i used to work for, you know some people were extremely religious and like understood the prob- the problems we were dealing with as a kind of, symptom of turning away from God and stuff and other people you know were Marxists and          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          you know so you, you know just cuz they're in the same organization they don't necessarily have the same analysis but, you wanna just think about that question.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          now what i want you to do though, is i want you to go home and start writing this right away.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>

          um i did (in) my interviews,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, which were really interesting,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> good </U2>
          but it seems like there's just so much,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          i just don't know how to, i don't know where to start          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. okay. um, alright... i wanna tell you to start number one by not starting with this.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          and here's why because um, you may be able to take much of this and put it into your paper          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, but, this is a very long and, many subjects          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          um, introduction where you in a way you say you know what you wanna          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          do. um, but you've gotta figure out how to, make that much shorter right?          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and tell me what you're gonna argue in this paper,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          and then and then pull out these themes          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (it's that) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> into, </OVERLAP1>
          sections.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um, so. what are, um, what do you think the argument of this paper is gonna be now...? outline of it...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          um, i thought with the whole like new model of the not quite white ethnic,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and, um, the way that race and class both play, an important role          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          um... and how just, um, in some ways they're just so different, um than the, not quite white ethnics in the fifties and sixties. but if, um, maybe like second or third generation, um, Indians could be considered like, a sort of new white, determining determinant on their class too though          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if they're </OVERLAP1>
          middle-class.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> not this other one in five          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          okay. um, great so what you should do, is, um, write me_ write a sort of first paragraph where you say that you are in some sense, in this paper gonna be testing the degree to which the not quite white ethnic, argument of Sugrue can be sort of, revised in the present, um, and in- and, investigating sort of how, s- race, and class kind of          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> work together </OVERLAP1>
          how class may in some sense, shape racial, categorization or whatever which is you know          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> a bit </OVERLAP1>
          what he talks about. um, now. what are the ways that your, the materials you've got from the interviews, and the um, and i think you're gonna have a great argument there that's gonna be really interesting. um, so what are the ways that the material you've got, both from these articles that you've read and from your interviews are gonna help you make that argument? what are the          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> kinds of </OVERLAP1>
          big themes or categories that you feel like          <OVERLAP1> come up? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          some of the ways that, um Indians view discrimination or experiences of discrimination, um it seems like it's more just based on their immigrant status than, race, um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's how they interpret it as          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          based on        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> more so,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, did for instance your father and mother assertively sort of make that kind of          <OVERLAP1> distinction? </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          my dad said something, to the effect that um, second-generation Indians will face discrimination but not the same way because we're American        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh, right          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um... </OVERLAP1>
          in what way does he think second generation, will experience discrimination and why?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um that's, i mean he was the only one who said          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> anything </OVERLAP1>
          about, but my mom, like she didn't say anything about that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh, okay. um, i'm just uh... i'm wondering if um, if this is an ig- i mean i- you know it's an insufficient material to work with in some sense but if this, if you're gonna use this, kind of argument of your father's as a way of um, arguing that, he is making a kind of claim not to whiteness particularly but, um, disclaiming, racial discrimination as,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          a factor and, and instead sort of focusing on the immigrant status if that's a way of kind of, distancing himself from the sort of racial hierarchies in this country. um, not, you know          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> distancing himself </OVERLAP1>
          but you know but that,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          that's a potential interpretation of it. um which is not necessarily a play for whiteness but it is a kind of        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's a different </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. it's a          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> sort of </OVERLAP1>
          argument against sort of, the importance of race in some way, you know? so you shou- just want might wanna think about that,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> okay. </OVERLAP1>
          so Indians' experiences of discrimination. one category        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um and then also, the way that, um, they view, African-Americans in,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          in America        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, well with my parents and my cousin, just um, equating, um like dangerous areas with being pre- predominantly          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          black communities. um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> did you get any          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> and </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> interesting </OVERLAP1>
          answers to your question of um, what they thought of sort of America and, race in America before they came versus when they came or?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um they kind of just like walked around that question.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh </U2>
          um,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> how did they walk around it? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean they said that they, </OVERLAP1>
          they learned stuff in school,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          but... i mean, i don't know. th- i think they were surprised by what_ my mom was just saying that when when she moved in, she started working, um at one clinic where most of, um the patients just came back from Vietnam and          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> were </OVERLAP1>
          heroin addicts, i think and she said that was p- huge culture shock,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          that it just happened that m- most of the patients          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          were black so she s- sort of thought of like poor and black but then she makes this distinction between_ because all the head, like the older, doctors who          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> worked </OVERLAP1>
          in the clinic were all black,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          so she made a distinction between like educated and then not          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right right </U2>
          um, and then they also said that, in all the clinics that they worked in that they knew that the only reason, um, why mostly Asian doctors were working there was because no white doctors would wanna work in the area.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. um </U2>
          yeah, um. the only thing my cousin said that she didn't know that um, people were so religious here.          <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          but she started working in Arkansas and sh- and i asked her if she fi- faced like did people ask you strange questions and she's like well when i worked in, Arkansas like nobody knew where India was and the the only          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> thing </OVERLAP1>
          that they wanted to be like, they were mostly concerned with is          <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> whether </OVERLAP1>
          you were saved or          <OVERLAP1> not </OVERLAP1>

          i was Christian,          <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          yeah, or if i believe in God and then, then it was alright        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and then just with bad experiences mm the one thing my cousin said that, um there was one patient who, um, just didn't like, Indian occupational therapists just because i_ well, she said that it wasn't because she had a bad experience but mostly cuz she was, like had a psychological problem i think she was schizophrenic but, that she was convinced that, she was this other therapist who, talked down to her or something like that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh </U2>
          and, she's like that's the only bad experience i've had and i don't think that has anything to do with, um, her not liking Indian people or          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>

          um, okay. uh          <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          alright now you've also got your, guy talking about sort of commonality          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um, between African-Americans and, um,          <WRITING> and Indian, Americans </WRITING>
          these are my little shorthands. um, did y- did uh, you get your parents to talk at all about that? did they,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          did you get any more info from          <OVERLAP1> him? </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> my, </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          no i didn't get any          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> that's okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> more </OVERLAP1>
          from him but, my dad did say something like, that um, even though they're immigrants they just have, it a lot better, a lot better off than, um, most African-Americans          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and... </OVERLAP1>
          but that they're just very different. that there's not really, many similarities,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          at all.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> um </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> which, </OVERLAP1>
          with like the, whole new model i wanted to talk about little bit of, how um, Indians still associate themselves so much with India too. there was one article with um, talking about community involvement,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          and how Indians just, really lack in that area and if there's, if there's a flood in India how the community'll come together and,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> raise </OVERLAP1>
          money for that but,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          if it happens in the U-S that they wouldn't, do that          <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
          yeah,          <OVERLAP1> well i mean </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> that kinda, </OVERLAP1>
          contradicts the whole achieving whiteness a little bit, just with their close ties to        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> to, India right          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          and there's a, there's a very good question, um, sorry here's a separate sort of topic uh (now we got)          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          just gonna like put topics all          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> over </OVERLAP1>
          here and we'll figure out something to do with them. um, okay so uh, right          <WRITING> closeness, to India </WRITING>
          um, and what that does to the not quite white ethnic argument. to, whiteness you know whatever becoming white.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, i mean that's a very good question i mean part, of your explanation you've already suggested is, i mean an open question of what happens with second and third generation          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> cuz </OVERLAP1>
          the immigrant population you're talking about, is you know, seventies and          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah,            <OVERLAP2> seventies and eighties </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know recent immigrants </OVERLAP1>
          um, and this is you know an open question for lots of people but um, one thing to think about is that uh we're in a really different, situation, um, in terms of the proximity of countries and stuff than          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> we were, </OVERLAP1>
          in the, in previous        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's true </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> big waves of immigration that led to, these not quite white ethnics that Sugrue was talking about. because </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can just, you know it's a lot          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> easier </OVERLAP1>
          to call and        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can call you can be in sort of constant email contact,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you can, you know maybe some places even like watch Indian, television          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          i mean in, in Chicago i used to get those Indian movies on T-V all the time which are          <EVENT WHO="S6" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          entirely incomprehensible both in form and language um, uh, i mean they're they're incredibly interesting. do you, did your, do your parents watch those? yeah?          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yep </U2>
          they're i mean they're          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> they're just, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> great but, they're </OVERLAP1>
          so different in s- in          <OVERLAP1> timing in style and, like everything they're really great </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> like musical comedies and, yeah i have i have friends </OVERLAP1>
          who'll never miss it it comes on like every Sunday        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so you know you can be in kind of constant contact with the          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> same </OVERLAP1>
          sort of cultural forms that are developing in India, um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> or even like private, um smaller businesses like with the, commu- cu- computer industry opening up that, a lot of Indian people have started their own businesses and then, go to India like every few ye- years not just for travel but for work too </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right. right so like, you wanna think about all those ways um, that um, those kinds of ties and see if you can like          <OVERLAP1> you know, tell me those kinds of ties </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> they're just really different. okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
          um... so the ways those kinds of ties may, mean that, maybe, we don't know. maybe second and third generation will maintain, at least some kind of closer identification with India than, um, was true of of Sugrue's not quite white ethnics. then you know like the, people who moved here from Italy always thought they were gonna go back too and, you know i mean there          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> there's some </OVERLAP1>
          ways that, that it may be, similar. um, so          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> or </OVERLAP1>
          even like how um families stress going back for visits,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          every few years          <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, </OVERLAP1>
          um, and even uh there're probably, um, there's probably a, big circulation of like Indian videos and stuff          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> back and </OVERLAP1>
          forth from, um you can prob- i mean i- are there Indian video stores that your parents go and rent, movies?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right so you know, and things like that that          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that didn't </OVERLAP1>
          exist before        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's true          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          or even clothing stores        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right or clothing_          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> yeah. </OVERLAP1>
          i mean all          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> sorts </OVERLAP1>
          of ways that, those ties can be maintained. um, so, that's one thing that is undermining, or or that is, maybe maybe has shifted. so here, we've got sort of two separate things going on here. this is one thing that's maybe sort of shifted the, meaning of the, of, your sort of not quite white argument right? so,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> this is </OVERLAP1>
          one way like it needs to be revised in the current context.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          um, uh, i have a feeling there's another way we've already talked about that it has to be revised          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          what just went away, in my head...?          <OVERLAP1> i can't re- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> ties to </OVERLAP1>
          India? no          <OVERLAP1> (not ties) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> ties to </OVERLAP1>
          India? no that's that category, okay um it'll come back to me. um... okay so what other themes?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um... see i don't know like what, i should put in the paper and what i just shouldn't cuz it just seems          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (sure) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          really off the topic but with um, with British colonialism and English          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          how um Indian immigrants usually have, had exposure to English in schools          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          rather, like compared to, most other Asian          <OVERLAP1> immigrants </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> immigrants </OVERLAP2>
            right          </U2>
          that don't.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so that almost puts them_ i mean like for English as a second language they're usually not Indian kids          <OVERLAP1> in that </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
            right          </U2>
          but, in one of the articles i guess that's changing          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> if </OVERLAP1>
          um, families from more rural areas in India that don't, have exposure to English then          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the </OVERLAP1>
          kids_ so i think in one community in New Jersey that they're having, Gujarati as one of the,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          like they're teaching classes in it          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> huh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> too so </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well i mean there may be uh, an example of, um, the kind of changing class of Indian immigrants right          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, it's r- </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i mean it's </OVERLAP1>
          rural also means um          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah and my my dad was talking yeah, he's just like, yeah, </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know not fully educated classes in India and India has its own rather intense class </OVERLAP1>
          structure um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that's what i thought i'd talk about cuz          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> when, </OVERLAP1>
          whenever um, the subject of racism would come up in my family like my parents would always talk about, in terms of India just          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> uhuh </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that, </OVERLAP1>
          you know it's it's different and, somehow like it, i dunno like their exposure to it is just so, different in terms of just what they've experienced in India so        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> in what kinds of ways do you think? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, i think just how intermarriage between castes is so, stigmatized          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          but, like my grandparents are from different castes, so it's like a love marriage not an arranged          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> marriage </OVERLAP1>
          and, um, i think maybe because of that they, seem a little more open-minded compared to most other Indian families          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> huh </U2>
          that, that we interact with          <OVERLAP1> but </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah </OVERLAP1>
          well i mean it's a it's an interesting question um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i thought          <OVERLAP1> background has a lot </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it's too many interesting </OVERLAP1>
          questions        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah because even talking like um, with some family friends um, just what_ well my parents, they just seem so different,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uhuh </U2>
          um like almost the exception but i think that's partially just their background        </U1>

          well go ahead        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the whole_ yeah for, like going along with that and then </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah like in a way i mean you could start with, laying out, i mean in some sense you've got to lay out what the not quite white argument is          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and what </OVERLAP1>
          it says about the relationships of, race and class right? so that would be your sort of section one.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
         <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          and          <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE READING"></EVENT>          um...        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> does Sugrue write any more about it besides, the one section in, is that from a book?          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> about </U2>
          the the not quite white ethnic?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it is          <OVERLAP1> from a book </OVERLAP1>

          okay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um </U2>
          i should probably look at that, look for that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's uh... um... it's called um, The Origins of the Urban Crisis.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          um, we read, cumulatively three chapters of it. uh, the homeowners chapter, the, economic change in Detroit chapter,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          the deindustrialization of Detroit,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and the </OVERLAP1>
          conclusion. um, um, i mean i don't think you need to go and read a bunch more.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          i mean you've done substantial work in that other paper, kind          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> oh yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> of laying </OVERLAP1>
          out the argument. um, and what you need to do is you know make that more succinct in some sense and, and make the point you wanna make about sort of race and class in some sense. um, and then, your second section would be, the way that, that this maybe still does work, to explain some things          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          so you've got the move to the suburbs you've got kind of a real internalization in some sense of the class structure, with like fears of intermarriage and stuff like that and, um, and you know some of this ways they view African-Americans would fit into that too          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          an awareness of the, spaces that Sugrue talks about of the sort of, dangerous, black spaces          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> maybe </OVERLAP1>
          and the safe white spaces in the suburbs, um, um but then, but then there're all sorts of ways that it, that it needs to be revised. um, and some are that you know, um, might be that there's some kind of awareness of commonality because of colonialism for some people          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay </U2>
          um, so here um, you know your parents make, class distinctions among African-Americans because they i mean they work closely with African-Americans          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so they, </OVERLAP1>
          they don't have a just very simple like black equals dangerous, street person, because          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they </OVERLAP1>
          have more daily contact than        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's true </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, uh, and, then you have your kind of um, bigger sort of also reasons that it might not, entirely work. you know? where the,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> er- </U2>
          the situation may have changed enough. um... and then you've got, i dunno exactly where this goes um, this probably goes in a way in the, the ways it works in some sense i mean you need to deal with the question of sort of what the class is of, Indians coming i don't_ it may fit in that section it may fit somewhere else i don't know it fits fairly central and early in, structuring in your          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> argument </OVERLAP1>
          um,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so how class also has a role? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right i mean if if, um Indian-Americans are coming over as educated professionals, or getting their education here, then they're kind of in the... you know upper middle-class,          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay </U2>
          um, which may shape their, um          <PAUSE DUR=":05" ></PAUSE>          you know i mean it i- e- it could make them, in Sugrue's argument be able to become white          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> um, </OVERLAP1>
          but of course as you have found in this those other art- newspaper articles that um, there are also new immigrants coming that maybe aren't so upper middle-class um that may, i mean          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> challenge that, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> they may have really different experiences. </OVERLAP1>
          uhuh. they may feel themselves much more racialized, um, uh and so, oh and your your little, we fit, in the middle          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          belongs          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> up here </OVERLAP1>
          too with the, kind of way that, maybe it it looks different now or, maybe Indian-Americans are a- both actively positioning themselves, um, not as white or as          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> black </OVERLAP1>
          but as something else um, and may also be positioned that way um, since there's an i mean, for, i mean there's a, there's a huge history in California or someplace like that of sort of, incredible hostility to, i mean long history of hostility to, Chinese-Americans and Japanese and um Latino. um, so, um, at least there there's kind of_ and and in some other places in the U-S, there's, a really long history of, um East-Asian immigrants that have been, um treated very badly and and, as you know that, a- a- s- it's kind of foundational parts of making a racial hierarchy in the          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SU" SEX="F" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         </U2>
