         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> (after all) </OVERLAP1>
          we've got you've got some other device tha- working on this thing which is why we need the I-S-A slot to begin with          <OVERLAP1> and (then it wouldn't be that bad) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so, so the the </OVERLAP1>
          important things (Rose) was gonna be big monitor, cuz we were gonna bring (the little) monitor upstairs, so like nineteen inch,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          instead of fifteen, seventeen. and, a big hard drive so we don't run out. and maybe, s- Matt had mentioned putting the Zip drive on.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> are you replacing the one that          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> i don't </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i think it </OVERLAP1>
          was your computer?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh no this would be for the the second kilohertz computer. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i have a suggestion though if you_ instead of for a Zip drive, we don't have a lot of them, and which means that they're not too useful. i me- they're use- i they're they're useful if everybody has one and you can trade Zip disks uh but if you don't have_ if you only have one then what's it useful for? so uh if you wanna get one why don't you get an outboard one, that we can then, um, whi- which you know that they also sell them you can,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> sure </U2>
          n- not expensive and and and that way, it can be hung off any anybody's computer if for some reason they need to have a Zip          <OVERLAP1> drive </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> SCSI </OVERLAP1>
          connecting Zip drive there is also like a printer port connecting Zip drive but that printer port supporting on is really slow.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so they they don't have U-S-B ones yet? </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the other thing i wondered about is Zip versus just rewritable C-Ds.          <U2 WHO="S5" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm </U2>
          i mean that's        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> well um, cer- certainly any any machine that you get is gonna have, uh a a uh rewritable C-D, drive on it. because it's more u- more useful than          <OVERLAP1> D-V-D say </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> sorry. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so i'm, i'm he's, c- he's emailing me a price quote, and then i need to talk to the software guy on Monday, he's out of town. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so we're gonna get a, so so so we're g- basically we're replacing the (OMA) but of course we'll still have the (OMA)          <OVERLAP1> so what are the </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> kay (well) what are, </OVERLAP1>
          i was gonna say what are we replacing it with? i don't know (if we were getting there)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh, the s- S-M-two forty C-D-I spectrometer. so, it's n- it's external miniature spectrometer and then internal card, internal C-P-two card. um </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay, so and does that come with a C-C-D          <OVERLAP1> (display?) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah, i-          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>

          um, right sorry.          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (xx) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the the external </OVERLAP1>
          thing is, is everything you need          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> if </U2>
          for the (OMA) and then you don't need (xx) but you get to the computer cuz it has its own internal, cable        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay          <OVERLAP1> so some some </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right i'm not using </OVERLAP1>
          the OMA though it's separate        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i-          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah, okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> i-it w- it's completely would the OMA would </OVERLAP1>
          be completely usable separately for a different experiment cuz it doesn't use any of the same parts          <U2 WHO="S6" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          in common not even the spectrometer. so, so then the question is, what are the capabilities of the new thing? so for example, how far out in the I-R can it go? how far out in the U-V can it go?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh the, what i told 'em we wanted, um is it's gonna be three-fifty to ten-fifty nanometers, all at once. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> three-fifty? is that enough for you?          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh </U2>
          he'd like          <OVERLAP1> three-twenty-three </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR">         <OVERLAP1> w- we want </OVERLAP1>
          three-twe- three-twenty so,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> probably get close to three-twenty </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> okay um </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> it sounds like </OVERLAP1>
          it sounds like it's got glass.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> you can't, he said you can go below three fifty, but it's gonna have to be a different grating than this one. and it would be,          <OVERLAP1> so, y- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> uhh mm </OVERLAP1>
          if it's only the grating, then i'm not worried at all because we can always replace the grating.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          if it's the C-C-D, then we should wa- get one that really is that has broader          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> sure </OVERLAP2>

       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yes, i think i have a lot of atoms in the focal volume right now. </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so, the big problem there was we could, somehow never get the intensity low enough to get into the right regime, it was always too high. and that's why we couldn't use that mirror. ultimately we never did use it.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

         <OVERLAP1> we used the </OVERLAP1>
          external focusing.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah and, and i guess for that, for Mark's, trying to get enough atoms to see anything, </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you need a larger, he needed          <OVERLAP1> a larger (volume) </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah. so, so there's, there's that kind of trade-off so i unless unless you're re- there's really a problem that you're up against,          <OVERLAP1> i'd keep it the same </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>

          there is. i'm i'm keeping the focal width the same. my only other question... do i need special B-N-C connectors to go inside, a high vacuum environment?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm. </U1>

          with, take a look at how it's done now. it's now done, with, a uh general radio connector.          <OVERLAP1> well actually there's a combination </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> see there're there're </OVERLAP1>
          two types of cone- connectors,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> but it's </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> there's, </OVERLAP1>
          the conical anode the, um forty millimeter one that i'm looking at has a B-N-T coming off the back. the, thing that i took off of your chamber has that androgynous i'm not sure what type of,          <OVERLAP1> thing it is, a- </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right, h- hermaphrodite </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          no, the the uh hermaphrodite connector is a kind of general radio connector.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay. </U2>
          the other kind of connector which is also called a general radio connector, uh i- which is sort of like a type N connector, if you know what that is. um, we had to change. so okay so this is what i was getting at. if you look inside that connector or inside a B-N-C connector you'll see that there's plastic cuz after all it's dielectric there's gotta be plastic somewhere. the most important thing is that that plastic has to, be able to s- withstand uh say two hundred and fifty degrees C. so that it will melt,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <EVENT WHO="S8" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and burn and cause a big smoke in your chamber as soon as you (xx) right? if you just take them, off the shelf they they have a kind of plastic that won't, take the high temperatures. and so what we did was we we bought the ki- those kinds of connectors, particularly that the the hermaphrodite one,          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          that kind of connector, we specifically are using that, because we can get at the plastic and pull it out and replace it with Teflon.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mkay. </U2>
          and uh, you know you've got that already. so i would just use the same thing we don't have to do that twice.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> except that at this point, the anode has a B-N-C connector on it and there might be, one other hermaphrodite connector is buried, before the B-N-C connector but i can't get that part open so i'm not convinced that it actually does open. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i really worry if you're using B-N-C that you that you have to make sure that you can bake it. it might be possible. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mine, but tha- the B-N-C connector_ i think actually what's in there is okay,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah (is it, oh) </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> because that, </OVERLAP1>
          that's what came out of the vacuum chamber, and then the other one is mounted on a (complat) flange so i think that's okay.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay it probably doesn't have B-N-C cable, on the other side right? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> no, no, no no no it's not a cable. </OVERLAP1>

          but, even like you know how when you look down inside the connector there's little white plastic things surrounding the,          <OVERLAP1> (metal socket) </OVERLAP1>

          so it's basically like a cross between the Millennium and the Quantronics you know you've the diode bar pumping in a rod just like you have in the Millennium, but it's Q switched so it's producing kilohertz.        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> that's right. </OVERLAP1>
          but i think any any um... uh the the uh sort of gradual transition that we're making, to a kilohertz, is going to mean that a lot of our important experiments particularly the atomic beam experiments, will be sort of designed to work at a kilohertz.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          and and there's al- there's there's bound to be more than one of those that you'd really wanna do at a time. so i i don't, i'm not concerned uh about that, option. i- i i'm more looking at, just a general upgrade you really don't want laser equipment to be twenty years old in in in a in a lab. because, it becomes like the old jalopy you put a spend a lot of time putting money into something that you should just once and for all replace with something newer.          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and uh so that means that, you have to budget these things and so we're budgeting this upgrade and and and now we have to do it. and the the thing to upgrade to is is the kilohertz          <OVERLAP1> laser. </OVERLAP1>

       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. </OVERLAP1>
          i i guess but there's the issue of which order do you do it in?          <OVERLAP1> (which is_ the oscillator) </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> um, based on </OVERLAP1>
          based on this discussion i i i'm leaning towards replacing the oscillator first because it seems like everybody's had some trouble with the oscillator. and that's the easy thing to replace it's also cheaper by the way but it doesn't matter that much          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          and and, uh so (maybe we'll do that.) before it gets too late, cuz we're gonna have to break up a little early because of Mike Duff's talk. everybody going to Mike Duff's talk i hope?        </U1>

          and so the deal is that, well maybe we can find a way to, to sort of filter all that stuff out, uh so that all we're left with is the important stuff. and so the cost functional uh compares the pulse shape that we have to a transform-limited pulse, and, it punishes, it punishes the pulse shapes for how much they differ, from the transform-limited, pulse shapes. so, the idea is that, you start off with a transform-limited pulse, and then you shape it. and, and uh, and the ones that you,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so the ones that d- how do you          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> how do </OVERLAP1>
          you evaluate how far you are from transform-limited?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> well that's, that's the trick,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay </U2>
          that we've b- that's what the cost functional is. but basically if you if you have two pulse shapes, that that uh, that do the same thing, that you get the same fitness out of, and one looks like a transform-limited pulse with a few modifications and one looks completely different, the one that looks completely different will be punished, and the one that th- looks more like the transform-limited won't so, the one that looks like the transform-limited pulse will get a much better fitness, for it. and,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think_            <OVERLAP2> that's like </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> yeah? </OVERLAP1>
         <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's kind of </U2>
          sure. and so, i guess we can, just look at_ so this is the formula that Tom sent basically,          <EVENT WHO="S3" DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"></EVENT>          uh what he's using, and, so what we do is, uh, we compare_ so the gene string is just the, uh just the phase at each, each pixel, and we compare pixel by pixel to what the phase would be for the transform-limited pulse, and, uh, and so we add up all those differences and that's actually squared right? that's just the, uh        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh it's either squared or          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> magnitude of </OVERLAP1>
          (i forget the right)        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh okay          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> so </OVERLAP1>
          so you so you adding up th- adding up phase differences aren't sort of uh the variance of the phase          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> basically </OVERLAP1>
          the square of the difference,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you're, you're adding that up, but the phase has a global ambiguity,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          so you're not really, adding that up, you're adding up, you have to somehow su- subtract off the linear,          <OVERLAP1> component. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> sure and that's </OVERLAP1>
          i mean we've talked about that a lot too. um        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i think,          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
          Tom i think To- this is what Tom uses i'm pretty sure.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> really? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          i think i think their issue is, that they're just program voltages on the pixels, and they don't have these, i think, i m- i would also guess the the operators tend not to put in the linear, sweep. and, you know some of our times some of_ sometimes we get, these straight linear phases and i think, they i don't think they do and so i don't think it's much of an issue. so we asked Tom, and he's like oh it really hasn't been a problem.        </U1>

       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i mean the_ how do you maintain the Gaussian shape without cl- and and and extending the pulse width          <OVERLAP1> without changing the frequency? </OVERLAP1>

          um, the pul- the pul- it's arbitrary phase shaping so the pulse is not gonna be Gaussian any more. so th-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> when you_ so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> you're you're asking about the transform-limited pulse that you compare things to? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S4" NSS="NNS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE" FLANG="KOR"> i thought, i mean probably i misunderstood but, you wanted to maintain the transform-limited pulse Gaussian pulse? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> no, no they don't want to maintain it. they simply want to um, get rid of extraneous garbage and their, their hypothesis about the extraneous garbage which i guess is something you didn't state, but their hypothesis about how how to, differentiate, garbage you don't want from stuff that you might want, is, by looking at the deviation of the phase from the phase that you'd get for transform-limited pulse. so, of course the the, there there's a bunch of problems with that that all come to mind i me- in a kind of a jumble. one is, the one we just talked about, that a Gaussian pulse in a different place doesn't have zero phase and so you have to worry about that. but, uh an- another one is that, you know consider a solution which is a beautiful looking solution just from a kind of aesthetic point of view of, two Gaussian pulses displaced from one another, in time. so it's just like a pump probe thing you're driving a wave packet, and the best solution is you just drive it once, drive it again. okay? there's gonna be a heavy cost here, for that pulse even though that's a perfectly good wonderful solution so i- it seems like th- the lack of sophistication in evaluating cost functional could really be hurting you in some cases. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> oh </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> um, yeah? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> w- would you run everything with cost functional or would you, like run          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> it was, i think </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> it and see what it gave </OVERLAP1>
          you and then just like try it with cost functional        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> it's designed to be a general tool for any of, any of the experiments in any form. so basically it, you know we can run some experiments and then we can also try 'em with the cost functional and we can try 'em with different weights on the cost functional.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and you just, it just goes into the fitness like on the bottom. so the new fitness is just the original fitness times like one plus the cost. and we we adjust the weighting such that, you know, the cost is, somewhere between zero and one basically.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah            <OVERLAP2> mkay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and </OVERLAP1>
          uh and so you know        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> so so thi- this is an alternative to something, that was what you guys tried sometimes in the past, which is, having a smoothing operator, that would, that you could just evaluate whether it was a good thing or not cuz of whether it increased the fitness, but the smoothing operator would get rid of extraneous high frequency stuff hi- phase noise for example mostly,          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          mostly that's what it got rid of.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's right it gets rid of the          <OVERLAP1> phase noise. </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so you could just </OVERLAP1>
          damp out out phase noise by having, the children always have less phase noise than the parents, in the G-A, and, the the trouble is that i- i- i- because that doesn't that's not a cost functional approach. that isn't just_ that that's a uh, in in a sense it's um, it's not allowing, uh rapid phase variations that might be very helpful, from making their importance understood. putting it into a cost functional means that it'll cost a little more but if it makes things that much better you still do it. smoothing it means you get rid of it, whether it was good for you or not. so,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>
          maybe this is better.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> alright so the basic idea is that, you know de- depending on what the weighting is, we're gonna, tell it how strong it should punish, anything that deviates from an unshaped pulse. and if, if uh something that deviates drastically has a much better fitness, that'll outweigh the cost. um, so. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and that's the trick, to adjust the weighting i guess so, um, you know you you like, you know you like the the weighting factor to be set so that, if you do have a r- a very good pulse shape but it doesn't look anything like a transform-limited pulse, that'll still be, the pulse that you, end up with i guess. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> unless          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> right? </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you have </OVERLAP1>
          really really high weighting on the cost function in which case,          <OVERLAP1> it's a it's a it's a different matter </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> right. well if you if you crank </OVERLAP1>
          up W high enough then, supposedly you should always get a transform-limited pulse.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay, yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> right? </OVERLAP1>
          because it'll like whatever your pul- your pulse shape is, uh that that'll just get, it'll t- totally drown it out, so, like whatever the actua- the sum of the the          <OVERLAP1> phases </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so </U2>
          okay        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> so Tom has then used this um and and (Jilla) and they he's had some good success with it. basically he had a data analysis that involved looking at, um, looking at the nominator frequency spectrum basically looking at, i guess you know kinda frequency differences in these (Rotmann) experiments, and um, and whether you get these, or whether they're present in the beam or not, and, and          <OVERLAP1> i mean </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> i'm </OVERLAP1>
          just afraid that the f-        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the analysis was cleaned up.          <OVERLAP1> the_ basically the analysis was cleaned up a lot by using the cost functional </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> yeah. i, i wouldn't wanna </OVERLAP1>
          i wouldn't wanna s- say this t- because it criticizes you know uh too too uh, too strongly because it criticizes his paper. but i have a feeling that the cost functional in Tom's case, is kind of a self-fulfilling, prophecy. i mean he says is the cost functional a good thing? well the cost functional is a good thing because, it produces the solutions that your, preconception about what a good solution is,          <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> yeah </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you know </OVERLAP1>
          what what you wanted. uh b- but it's it's not, it's it's going away from the uh real notion of the G-A as a learning machine, where it's finding for you the best solution independent of your preconceptions. cuz it's kind of introducing a preconception bias. and in this case it really came out with Tom because, his preconception bias, was that he was looking for simple spectral signatures. it was in the non linear spectrum but nonetheless he was looking for simple spectral signatures, things that could be easily wiped out by phase noise. and so he had something in there that would make all of the solutions not have much phase noise and, by golly he could see his simple spectral signatures it doesn't really mean that that's the best solution.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> well we've also yet to craft a G-A that that ha- eliminates nonfatal mutations too. so </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah we don't have a better way to eliminate nonfatal mutations a- apart from just going in, uh to the_ looking at a solution, and just feature by feature, modifying it, just l- you know, that's_ course that also, defeats the purpose of the G-A you're not optimizing things uh you're not letting it optimize things for you if you can do that. </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah i- i- it gets into a validation issue really and, um, and i- i've seen the same thing in medical imaging with iterative r- approaches, how much side information can you stick in the e- the image pr- process without biasing the image you end up with?          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> right </U2>
          um, and, so i mean for a particular problem i think it makes a lot of sense to, you know use a cost functional and then maybe compare it to, a non cost f- cost functional approach and make sure there's some kind of convergence,          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          going on but, as a general rule you're not necessarily gonna be able to do that it you, if you work with a system that you don't know much about, you know and where you (said) maybe something that looks like a series of pulses might be the best solution.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          you know a priori there's no reason to say oh the Gaussian is the best or the transform-limited is, the model, we should use.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean as long as we're able to run them back to back, i think we can avoid those sort of problems just because you can run it without, and you can run it with and you can compare what the pulse shapes look like          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and you can also </OVERLAP1>
          compare what the best fitness was and if, if you seriously degrade the fitness in order to change, the pulse shape then you know you're you're in trouble. but        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> the reason i i guess it seems like if you, get a pulse shape without the cost functional, that looks nothing like the Gaussian, that's, huh,          <OVERLAP1> so so i i if you get one </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> but but there's there's always a chance </OVERLAP1>
          that you could have just as good a fitness, with something that looks much more, uh smooth... there's always a chance that        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> and, when you use the how much it looks like a Gaussian, is that, what's F-zero </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> F-zero's like the original fitness. without, so the new          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> fitness is </OVERLAP1>
          is what what its well          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> what </OVERLAP1>
          its fitness is, and then you add on this mathematical cost.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> so the more cost there is the higher fitness it has? </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> uh i- the minus sign is, i should put plus or minus.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah,            <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> the minus </OVERLAP1>
          sign depends on, on what the sign of your fitness and your cost are. so          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> okay.            <OVERLAP2> so </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> but, </OVERLAP1>
          you're right... uh, so if the fitness is positive and the cost is positive it should be a minus.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> i i          <OVERLAP1> guess it would be nice if we had a problem_ oh </OVERLAP1>
       </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">         <OVERLAP1> so it seems like </OVERLAP1>
          it seems like the absolute number of the fitness, of something with or without the cost functional would completely depend on, how much weight you put on it.          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
         <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>

          i'm not sure how you can compare something, without. like, when you go through you get a pulse rate without the cost functional, and it has a fitness of, two-point-seven, or whatever, and i am not sure,          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean </U2>
          how c- how can you compare the two numbers you get for the fitness with the cost functional, if it's not like it doesn't seem like it would be a comparable number scale so how can you say          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> the </U2>
          whether it's more or less fit?        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> i mean the the weighting has to be, the w- the the value of W has to be has to be, examined bu- tha-          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> mhm </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> you can't </OVERLAP1>
          just set W. and so, you know you could, you could, you know let's say you get a fitness of two-point-seven, just just the fitness let's say you evaluate the pulse and you get two-point-seven. and then, let's say you evaluate, you could evaluate another pulse shape that looks almost like a transform limit, and you also might get, two-point-six-five, or something. but of course the G-A, cuz it works so well, always finds the two-point-seven. and so that's what you see as your solution after thirty generations.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then, you might've completely lost the fact that there's one that's just a little worse, that is almost transform-limited or something like that.          <U2 WHO="S8" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="F" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> okay </OVERLAP2>
         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> and then this way the </OVERLAP1>
          cost, functional would bring bring the, the two-point-seven down to like two-point-five or something.          <U2 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          and then not even it up with the two-point-six-five.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> of course if that were really true, the example that you said, then you'd have to wonder what was being added that made the fitness always better, for the noisier pulse and there might be some physics there and you'd never know that physics          <U2 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> mhm </U2>
          if you're just using the cost functional so,        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S3" NSS="NS" ROLE="JG" SEX="M" AGE="1" RESTRICT="NONE"> there's uh well,          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE"> that's good. </U2>
          like everything else with, learning algorithms, you know it's there's the          <OVERLAP1> we it's a learning process. </OVERLAP1>
         <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>         <OVERLAP1> it's really </OVERLAP1>
          it's really it's really hard to make definitive statements about which procedure's better and which procedure's worse there there there's always a trade-off        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> i- it would be nice if you if you had a problem that ha- you, had very good reason to believe that a really wacky pulse shape was indeed the best shape, and then run this into this approach and see how close to zero you have to make W to make this work.          <U2 WHO="S2" NSS="NS" ROLE="SG" SEX="M" AGE="2" RESTRICT="NONE"> yeah </U2>
         <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          at well at least that might set a bound on how much you should weight it.        </U1>

         </U2>
         <OVERLAP1> like </OVERLAP1>
          (the only thing) when you were doing with the two modes there was the one that was d- actually was a two pulse, solution. something like that would look nothing like the Gaussian.        </U1>
       <U1 WHO="S1" NSS="NS" ROLE="SF" SEX="M" AGE="3" RESTRICT="NONE"> mm well, i wanna make sure that we can, get over to_ in time to eat cookies of course that's the most important part.          <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"></EVENT>          if you can't eat enough cookies then you can't          <U2 WHO="SU-m" NSS="NS" ROLE="UN" SEX="M" AGE="0" RESTRICT="NONE">           <OVERLAP2> (sleep) </OVERLAP2>
