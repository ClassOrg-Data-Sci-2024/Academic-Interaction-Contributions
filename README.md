## Project Summary

This Data Science course project examines the amount of speech that is contributed by individuals participating in academic interactions and analyzes the effects that interaction type, number of participants, and participant identity/position/role have on an individual's contributions.

## Project Data

The [data](Data/) used in this project comes from the [Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/micase/) (MICASE).
MICASE contains transcriptions and XML files for 152 academic speech events at the University of Michigan between 1997 and 2002. 
In addition to the transcribed speech, the XML files contain metadata tags about the speech event and the speakers.
The data used in this project is a subset of 75 transcripts that were tagged by MICASE as "Highly interactive" or "Mostly interactive" events.
Additional information about this data set was found in the [MICASE Manual](https://ca.talkbank.org/access/0docs/MICASE.pdf) that is hosted on [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/).
The use and distribution of the transcripts from the MICASE website is allowed under the MICASE copyright statement, which is included below.
